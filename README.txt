The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of 
C++ software development modules for sonar modeling and simulation. 
The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML 
that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using 
Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates. At this time, 
most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D. 

Instructions for building and testing this library are provided
in the usml_install.html file.  Documentation for the users of
this model is created from the source code using Doxygen.
