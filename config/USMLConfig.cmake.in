# CMake config file for the Under Sea Modeling Library (USML).
# 
# Includes USMLUse.cmake to setup interfaces to Boost and NetCDF.
# Defines the directories in which USML files found.
#
# When successful, it defines the following variables
#
#   USML_INCLUDE_DIR    Parent directory for installed USML header files
#   USML_LIBRARY        Path of the installed libXXX.{so,a}
#   USML_INCLUDE_DIRS   USML_INCLUDE_DIR and all prerequisite directories
#   USML_LIBRARIES      USML_LIBRARY and all prerequisite libraries
#   USML_FOUND          True if this library found
#
# Features:
#
#   * Sets up access to header files for Boost's uBLAS package
#   * Sets up access to header files and libraries for Boost' Test package.
#       - This includes both optimized and debug versions of the Boost libraries.
#       - Although not technically required in the run-time environment,
#         this allows USML users to define Boost Tests with no extra effort.
#   * Sets up access to header files and libraries for NetCDF package.
#	   - On windows, this includes an embedded version of netcdf_c++ 
#         that acts as a work around for missing library on this platform.
#   * Sets up access to header files and libraries for USML package.
#       - This includes both optimized and debug versions of the USML libraries,
#         if the debug library is available.
