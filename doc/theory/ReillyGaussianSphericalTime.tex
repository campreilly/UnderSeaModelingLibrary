The Wavefront Queue \threeD (WaveQ3D) model is a research effort to create fast and accurate acoustic transmission loss (TL) eigenrays, in littoral environments, for active sonar simulation/stimulation systems.  WaveQ3D is based on ray theory because Parabolic Equation and Normal Mode models run prohibitively slow at active sonar frequencies above 1000 Hz, where the number of propagating modes is large.  To extend applicability to lower frequencies, WaveQ3D augments ray theory with Gaussian beam techniques based on the Gaussian Ray Bundling (GRAB), which is certified for use down to 150 Hz. WaveQ3D is unique among Gaussian beam models in that it solves the eikonal equation in spherical Earth coordinates. The premise of this approach is that, when scenario geometries are constantly evolving, it is more computationally efficient to perform acoustic transmission loss (TL) in the latitude, longitude, altitude coordinates of the underlying environmental databases, than it is to convert the \threeD environments into a series of \twoDxN Cartesian slices.  This approach also has the benefit of supporting out-of-plane, \threeD effects.

\section{Introduction}

Sonar simulation/stimulation systems convert the real-time evolution of complex scenarios into acoustic signals, which are then injected into the sonar, and presented to the operator.  They are often used to teach sonar operators to recognize and react to acoustic phenomena, in a controlled environment, at a much lower cost than at-sea exercises.  Unfortunately, there has been very little success in creating acoustic models that can compute results in real-time, for dynamic scenarios, in littoral environments, without significant losses in accuracy.\footnote{Discussion with Michael Vaccaro, project manager for the High Fidelity Active Sonar Training
(HiFAST) Project at the U.S. Office of Naval Research.}  Most of the successes to date have involved the use of massively parallel computing systems with high acquisition costs.

The Wavefront Queue \threeD (WaveQ3D) model is a research effort to create fast and accurate acoustic transmission loss (TL) eigenrays, in littoral environments, for active sonar simulation/stimulation systems. In addition to TL, these eigenrays include the multipath travel time, phase, and propagation direction information needed by sonar simulation/stimulation systems.  Our computation speed goal is to model one-way transmission loss for 100 targets on a single core of an average laptop.

WaveQ3D is based on ray theory because Parabolic Equation and Normal Mode models run prohibitively slow at active sonar frequencies above 1000 Hz, where the number of propagating modes is large.  To extend applicability to lower frequencies, WaveQ3D augments ray theory with Gaussian beam techniques based on the Gaussian Ray Bundling (GRAB),\cite{Weinberg1996} which is certified for use down to 150 Hz.\cite{GRAB2008}  
WaveQ3D is unique among Gaussian beam models\cite{Cerveny1982, Porter1994,Porter1987} in that it solves the eikonal equation in spherical Earth coordinates.\footnote{Although the Ray-Tracing Program for the Ocean (HARPO) model \cite{Jones1986} also computes ray paths on a curved Earth, its use of the Hamilton on an elliptical Earth introduces complexity that we do not believe will impact training scenarios.  HARPO also does not compute transmission loss and other eigenrays products at this time.} The premise of this approach is that, when scenario geometries are constantly evolving, it is more computationally efficient to perform acoustic transmission loss (TL) in the latitude, longitude, altitude coordinates of the underlying environmental databases, than it is to convert the \threeD environments into a series of 2-DxN Cartesian slices.  This approach also has the side benefit of supporting out-of-plane, \threeD effects.

The creation of the WaveQ3D model required the derivation of new equations for ray tracing, reflection, eigenrays finding, and Gaussian beam propagation loss. This paper introduces WaveQ3D to the research community by outlining that derivation.  Future papers will focus on the accuracy of the WaveQ3D model relative to analytic solutions and at-sea results.

\section{Ray Tracing in Spherical/Time Coordinates}

Ray theory decomposes acoustic waves into surfaces of constant travel time
(\(t\)) from the source (Fig.~\ref{fig:geometry}). The rays are a vector
field that is normal to these surfaces at each point in space, and the route of
these rays through the medium defines the direction of propagation. In the
high frequency limit, spreading loss occurs as the energy of the wavefront
is stretched over increasingly larger areas during propagation. Conventional ray
theory uses the change in distance between rays to model the spreading
effects of wavefront propagation.
\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=2in]{AcousticRayGeometry.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Acoustic ray geometry.  \label{fig:geometry}}
\end{figure}
The fundamental equations of ray theory are derived\cite{Jensen1994} by
seeking solutions to the Helmholtz equation (\ref{eq:helmholtz}) in the
form given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:helmholtz_solution})
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^2p + \frac{\omega^2}{c^2(\vec{r})} p(\vec{r}) 
		= -\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_0)
	\label{eq:helmholtz}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	p(\vec{r}) = e^{i \omega t(\vec{r}) } 
		\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{ A_j(\vec{r}) }{(i\omega)^j} \:.
	\label{eq:helmholtz_solution}
\end{equation}

Equating terms of like order in \(\omega\), yields the infinite sequence of
equations given by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:eikonal}), (\ref{eq:transport}), and
(\ref{eq:diffraction})
\begin{equation}
	O(\omega^2) : \left| \vec{\nabla}t \right|^2 = \frac{1}{c^2(\vec{r})} \:,
	\label{eq:eikonal}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	O(\omega) : 2\vec{\nabla}A_0 \cdot \vec{\nabla}t + (\nabla^2t)A_0 = 0 \:,
	\label{eq:transport}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	O(\omega^{1-j}) : 2\vec{\nabla}A_j \cdot \vec{\nabla}t + (\nabla^2t)A_j 
		= -\nabla^2 A_{j-1} \qquad \text{for j=1,2,...}
	\label{eq:diffraction}
\end{equation}
where 
\(\vec{r}\) is the position coordinate along a ray path;
$c$ is the speed of sound in water; 
$A$ is the wavefront amplitude; and 
$t$ is the travel time along the ray path. 
The eikonal equation (\ref{eq:eikonal}) defines the relationship between
the direction of propagation and the speed of sound in water. The first
transport equation (\ref{eq:transport}) relates the spreading loss of the
acoustic field to the divergence in the propagation direction. The
remaining transport equations (\ref{eq:diffraction}) relate the spreading
loss of the acoustic field to diffraction effects. Eqs.~(\ref{eq:eikonal})
and (\ref{eq:transport}) are an exact solution of the wave equation in the
geometric limit, that is, when the sound speed gradient along the direction
of motion changes slowly compared to the acoustic wavelength. Conventional ray theory accuracy
starts to break down at lower frequencies where diffraction becomes a
significant feature of acoustic propagation.

The analytic solution to the eikonal equation (\ref{eq:eikonal}) is
found\cite{Jensen1994} by relating \(\vec{\nabla}t\) to \(\hat{n}\), the
direction of energy propagation along the ray paths
\begin{equation}
	\hat{n} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{ds} = c \vec{\nabla}t \:.
	\label{eq:ray_paths}
\end{equation}

This transforms the eikonal equation into a second order ordinary
differential equation in terms of \(\vec{r}\), $c$, and $s$
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d}{ds} \left( \frac{1}{c} \frac{d\vec{r}}{ds} \right) 
		= -\frac{1}{c^2} \vec{\nabla}c \:.
	\label{eq:ode2}
\end{equation}

This can be reduced to a pair of simultaneous first order equations by
introducing the temporary variable \(\vec{\xi}\)
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{\xi}}{ds} = -\frac{1}{c^2} \vec{\nabla}c \:,
	\label{eq:dxi_ds}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{r}}{ds} = c \vec{\xi} \:.
	\label{eq:dr_ds}
\end{equation}

This set of equations can be solved using a series of arc length steps
given initial conditions.\cite{Yakowitz1986,Press1992}
Note that although
the ray paths represented by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:dxivec_dt}) and
(\ref{eq:drvec_dt}) are independent of frequency, the loss along those
paths will include the frequency dependent effects of seawater absorption
and interface reflection.

Equation~(\ref{eq:dr_ds}) illustrates that the temporary variable
\(\vec{\xi}\) is actually the direction of propagation scaled by the speed
of sound, or equivalently, the wave number vector divided by the angular
frequency
\begin{equation}
	\vec{\xi} = \frac{\hat{n}}{c} = \frac{\vec{k}}{\omega} \:,
	\label{eq:n_c}
\end{equation}
where 
\(\vec{k}\) is the acoustic wave number vector; and
\(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the acoustic source.
This definition of \(\vec{\xi}\) allows the system of equations represented
by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:dxi_ds}) and (\ref{eq:dr_ds}) to be initialized with the
position and steering angle for each ray path at the acoustic source.
Note that the steering angle is defined using the depression/elevation (\(\mu\)) and the azimuthal steering (\(\varphi\)) launch angles of each ray relative to the source.  
Marching the simultaneous first order equations (\ref{eq:dxi_ds}) and (\ref{eq:dr_ds}) through steps in arc length then
generates ray paths throughout the water column. The spreading loss of the
wavefront at any point is calculated by measuring the spreading between
adjacent rays. As adjacent rays have different travel times in this
treatment, there is an implicit assumption that propagation loss is being
calculated for a continuous ensonification at a single frequency.

Instead of solving the ray equations in units of arc-length, WaveQ3D uses a change of variables (Eq.~(\ref{eq:d_ds})) to transform equations (\ref{eq:dxi_ds}) and (\ref{eq:dr_ds}) into functions of time.

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d}{ds} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{d}{dt} \:, 
	\label{eq:d_ds}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{\xi}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{c} \vec{\nabla}c \:,
	\label{eq:dxivec_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = c^2 \vec{\xi} \:.
	\label{eq:drvec_dt}
\end{equation}

Computing acoustic propagation as a function of time has several advantages for training system implementations.  First, because phase coherence between rays is preserved at each step, discontinuities between ray paths are reduced.  Second, it allows the implementation to return propagation results to the calling program, in travel time order, before later paths have been computed.  Third, it casts the solutions into a form that is very useful for calculating reverberation.

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{SphericalEarthCoordinates.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Spherical earth coordinates.}
	\label{fig:earth}
\end{figure}
The WaveQ3D model uses the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS--84)\cite{WGS84} reference ellipse to represent zero altitude worldwide (mean sea level). A
spherical polar coordinate system is constructed within each area of
operations, and its radius is set equal to the WGS--84 radius of curvature
at the center of the area. This coordinate system is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:earth} 
where 
\(\chi\) is latitude;
\(\phi\) is longitude; 
$h$ is altitude above mean sea level;
$R$ is radius of earth's curvature for the area of operations;
$r$ is distance from the center of curvature (R+h); and 
\(\theta\) is co-latitude (\(90^\circ-\chi\)).

The WaveQ3D model defines the average radius of curvature in the area of
operations using a combination of WGS--84 radii in the latitude and
longitude directions\cite{Jones1986}
\begin{equation}
	w^2 \equiv 1 - e^2 cos\chi \:,
	\label{eq:w^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	R_\chi = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{w^3} \:,
	\label{eq:R_chi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	R_\phi = \frac{a}{w} \:,
	\label{eq:R_phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	R = \sqrt{ R_\chi R_\phi }
	\label{eq:Rtotal}
\end{equation}
where 
$e$ is the WGS--84 elliptic eccentricity of earth (8.1819190842622x10\textsuperscript{-2});
$a$ is the WGS--84 equatorial radius of the earth (6378137.0~m);
(\(R_\chi\),\(R_\phi\)) are the radii of curvature in the latitude and longitude directions; 
and $R$ is the average radius of curvature in area of operations.  

From these definitions, all locations in the area of operations can be
represented in terms of the spherical polar properties
($r$,\(\theta\),\(\phi\)). The transformation of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:dxivec_dt})
and (\ref{eq:drvec_dt}) into this coordinate system uses the fact that the
ray position only has radial components, while the ray direction has
components in all three dimensions.\footnote{This derivation uses arrows for
vectors with magnitude and direction (such as \(\vec{r}\)), carets for unit
length vectors (such as \(\hat{r}\)), and plain text for magnitude
parameters (such as $r$).}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{r}(t) = r(t) \hat{r}(t) \:,
	\label{eq:spherical1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{\xi}(t) = \alpha(t) \hat{r}(t) + \beta(t) \hat{\theta}(t) 
		+ \gamma(t) \hat{\phi}(t) \:,
	\label{eq:spherical2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{dr}{dt} \hat{r} + r \frac{d\hat{r}}{dt} \:,
	\label{eq:spherical3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{\xi}}{dt} = \frac{d\alpha}{dt} \hat{r} + \alpha \frac{d\hat{r}}{dt}
	+ \frac{d\beta}{dt} \hat{\theta} + \beta \frac{d\hat{\theta}}{dt}
	+ \frac{d\gamma}{dt} \hat{\phi} + \gamma \frac{d\hat{\phi}}{dt}
\label{eq:spherical4}
\end{equation}
where 
\(\alpha(t)\), \(\beta(t)\), and \(\gamma(t)\) are the radial,
co-latitude, and longitude components of the normalized ray direction.
Note that the unit vectors \(\hat{r}\), \(\hat{\theta}\), and \(\hat{\phi}\) 
in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:spherical3}) and (\ref{eq:spherical4})
change as a function of $r$, \(\theta\),
and \(\phi\). The impact of these derivatives can be understood by casting
them into their Cartesian coordinate equivalents before applying the time
derivative
\begin{equation}
	\hat{r}(t) = sin\theta(t) \: cos\phi(t) \: \hat{i}
		+ sin\theta(t) \: sin\phi(t) \: \hat{j}
		+ cos\theta(t) \: \hat{k} \:,
	\label{eq:rhat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\theta}(t) = cos\theta(t) \: cos\phi(t) \: \hat{i}
		+ cos\theta(t) \: sin\phi(t) \: \hat{j}
		- sin\theta(t) \: \hat{k} \:,
	\label{eq:thetahat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\phi}(t) = - sin\phi(t) \: \hat{i} + cos\phi(t) \: \hat{j} \:.
	\label{eq:phihat}
\end{equation}

The chain rule, when applied to Eqs.~(\ref{eq:rhat}), (\ref{eq:thetahat}),
and (\ref{eq:phihat}) yields the following time derivatives in spherical
coordinates
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\hat{r}}{dt} = \frac{d\theta}{dt} \hat{\theta} 
		+ sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \hat{\phi} \:,
	\label{eq:rhat_dt} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\hat{\theta}}{dt} = - \frac{d\theta}{dt} \hat{r} 
		+ cos\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \hat{\phi} \:,
	\label{eq:thetahat_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\hat{\phi}}{dt} = - sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \hat{r} \:.
	\label{eq:phihat_dt}
\end{equation}

Applying Eqs.~(\ref{eq:rhat_dt}) through (\ref{eq:phihat_dt}) to
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:spherical3}) and (\ref{eq:spherical4}) transforms the ray
tracing equations into spherical earth coordinates
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{dr}{dt} \hat{r} + r \frac{d\theta}{dt} \hat{\theta} + r sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \hat{\phi} \:,
	\label{eq:rays_r}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\frac{d\vec{\xi}}{dt} = \left[ \frac{d\alpha}{dt} - \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
			+ \gamma sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \right] \hat{r}
		  	+ \left[ \frac{d\beta}{dt} + \alpha \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
		  	- \gamma cos\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} \right] \hat{\theta} \\ 
	  	+ \left[ \frac{d\gamma}{dt} + \left( \alpha sin\theta 
	  	+ \beta cos\theta \right) \frac{d\phi}{dt} \right] \hat{\phi} \:.
	  	\label{eq:rays_xi}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

Matching terms for \(\hat{r}\), \(\hat{\theta}\), and \(\hat{\phi}\) yields
a system of six first-order, scalar differential equations
\begin{equation}
\frac{dr}{dt} = c^2 \alpha \:,
\label{eq:sixscalar1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	r \frac{d\theta}{dt} = c^2 \beta \:,
	\label{eq:sixscalar2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	r sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} = c^2\gamma \:,
	\label{eq:sixscalar3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\alpha}{dt} - \beta \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
		- \gamma sin\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} 
		= -\frac{1}{c}\frac{dc}{dr} \:,
	\label{eq:sixscalar4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\beta}{dt} + \alpha \frac{d\theta}{dt} 
		- \gamma cos\theta \frac{d\phi}{dt} 
		= -\frac{1}{cr}\frac{dc}{d\theta} \:,
	\label{eq:sixscalar5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\gamma}{dt} + \left( \alpha sin\theta 
		+ \beta cos\theta \right) \frac{d\phi}{dt} 
		= -\frac{1}{cr sin\theta}\frac{dc}{d\phi} \:.
	\label{eq:sixscalar6}
\end{equation}

When Eqs.~(\ref{eq:sixscalar1}) though (\ref{eq:sixscalar3}) are plugged
into Eqs.~(\ref{eq:sixscalar4}) though (\ref{eq:sixscalar6}), the system is
reduced to a state where all of the coordinate derivatives appear only once

\begin{equation}
	\frac{dr}{dt} = c^2 \alpha \:,
	\label{eq:dr_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{c^2 \beta}{r} \:,
	\label{eq:dtheta_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\phi}{dt} = \frac{c^2\gamma}{r sin\theta} \:,
	\label{eq:dphi_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\alpha}{dt} = -\frac{1}{c}\frac{dc}{dr} 
		+ \frac{c^2}{r}\left( \beta^2 + \gamma^2 \right) \:,
	\label{eq:dalpha_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\beta}{dt} = -\frac{1}{cr}\frac{dc}{d\theta} 
		- \frac{c^2}{r} \left( \alpha \beta + \gamma^2 cot\theta \right) \:.
	\label{eq:dbeta_dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\gamma}{dt} = -\frac{1}{cr sin\theta}\frac{dc}{d\phi} 
		- \frac{c^2 \gamma}{r} \left( \alpha + \beta cot\theta \right) \:,
	\label{eq:dgamma_dt}
\end{equation}
WaveQ3D uses Equations (\ref{eq:dr_dt}) through (\ref{eq:dgamma_dt}) to compute the time evolution for the location and direction for any acoustic ray based on its initial conditions. These equations include the horizontal refraction effects and follow great circle routes between
as they traverse latitudes and longitude. Environmental parameters and their derivatives are computed directly in geographic latitude, longitude, and altitude without reducing the problem to a series of \twoDxN Cartesian projections.

The WaveQ3D model uses an explicit, third order, Adams-Bashforth (AB3) algorithm\cite{Yakowitz1986} to propagate Eqs.~(\ref{eq:dr_dt}) through (\ref{eq:dgamma_dt}) numerically. The AB3 algorithm, summarized in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:AB3_algorithm}), approximates each step in the solution using cached information from the three time steps that came before it
\begin{equation}
	\vec{f}(t_{n+1}) = \vec{f} (t_{n}) + \delta t \left[ 
		\frac{23}{12} \frac{d\vec{f}}{dt}(t_n)
	  	- \frac{16}{12} \frac{d\vec{f}}{dt}(t_{n-1}) 
	  	+ \frac{5}{12} \frac{d\vec{f}}{dt}(t_{n-2}) \right] \:.
	\label{eq:AB3_algorithm}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{f}$ is a vector of the positions, directions, and their derivatives such that
\begin{equation}
	\vec{f} = \left[ r, \theta, \phi, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \frac{dr}{dt}, \frac{d\theta}{dt}, \frac{dr\phi}{dt}, 
		\frac{d\alpha}{dt}, \frac{d\beta}{dt}, \frac{d\gamma}{dt} \right] .
\end{equation}
When the past values are cached instead of re-calculated, AB3 is much faster
than other integrators with similar accuracy. However, because AB3 is not self-starting,
the WaveQ3D model uses a third order Runge-Kutta (RK3) algorithm\cite{Press1992}
whenever the ray parameters must be initialized, or re-initialized

During the development of WaveQ3D, we discovered that the inclusion of spherical coordinate terms in Eqs. (\ref{eq:dr_dt}) through (\ref{eq:dgamma_dt}) had very little impact on the speed of ray trace calculations.  The types of training applications that we are targeting rely on gridded environmental data that has been derived from at-sea measurements.  We found that the interpolations needed to compute the sound speed and its derivatives from gridded data were much more computationally expensive than algebraic or trigonometric functions because of the search operations inherent in interpolation.  This difference becomes even more pronounced if terms like \(sin\theta\) and $c^2/r$ are cached at the time that they are first used 

\section{Boundary Reflections on a Spherical Earth}

	\caption{Horizontal refraction from 3-D slope.
	\label{fig:wedge_3d}}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:wedge_3d} illustrates WaveQ3D out-of-plane reflection from a 3-D slope.  
In this example, a single ray is launched obliquely up a 2.86 degree slope.  
Each time the ray reflects from the bottom, the tilt of the normal turns the ray slightly down slope.
Eventually the ray stops traveling up toward the apex and turns down slope.  
Rays with steep launch angle have more bottom reflections and turn down slope faster than shalllow-angle rays.

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{EstPointCollision.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Estimating the point of reflection. }
	\label{fig:reflection_time}
\end{figure}

Interface reflection in WaveQ3D starts with an estimate of the point in time when the incident ray strikes the bottom.  The derivation of the equations for estimating the time of reflection in spherical coordinates uses the symbols defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:reflection_time} where
\(\vec{I}\) is the incident ray path;
\(\zeta\) is the incident grazing angle;
\(\hat{s}\) is the surface normal;
\(\hat{r}\) is the unit vector in the radial direction;
\(h\) is the incident ray height above bottom;
\(\Delta t\) is the normal time step; and
\(\delta t\) is the time step needed to reach the interface.  
Note that, to simplify the geometry, Fig.~\ref{fig:reflection_time} is drawn in the plane of reflection.   Fig.~\ref{fig:reflect3d} illustrates this same scenario in a \threeD perspective.

If the bottom slope is nearly constant across the length of the incident
ray, then the ratio of the time steps is equivalent to the ratio of the
distances normal to the surface
\begin{equation}
	d_1 \equiv - \vec{I} \cdot \hat{s} 
		= - \left( \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \cdot \hat{s} \right) \Delta t \:,
	\label{eq:reflection_d1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_2 \equiv - h \hat{r} \cdot \hat{s} \:,
	\label{eq:reflection_d2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\delta t}{\Delta t} = \frac{d_2}{d_1} 
		= \cfrac{h \: \hat{r} \cdot \hat{s}}{\left( \cfrac{d\vec{r}}{dt} 
		\cdot \hat{s} \right) \Delta t} \:,
	\label{eq:reflection_ratio}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\delta t = \cfrac{h \: \hat{r} \cdot \hat{s}}{\cfrac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \cdot \hat{s}} \:.
	\label{eq:reflection_time_bottom}
\end{equation}
At the ocean surface, this simplifies to
\begin{equation}
	\delta t_{surface} = \frac{h}{\frac{dr}{dt}} \:,
	\label{eq:reflection_time_surface}
\end{equation}
where \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) is the radial ray tracing component defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:dr_dt}).

	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Reflection from a \threeD slope.}
	\label{fig:reflect3d}
\end{figure}
The next step in WaveQ3D reflection modeling is estimating the direction of
reflection from a \threeD slope. The derivation of the equations for
estimating this direction in spherical coordinates uses the
symbols defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:reflect3d} 
where
\(\hat{I}\) is the incident ray path direction;
\(\hat{R}\) is the reflected ray path direction; and
\(\vec{B}\) is the component of the incident ray that is perpendicular to surface normal.
Since the reflected ray has the same angle to the normal as the incident ray
\begin{equation}
\hat{R} = 2\vec{B} - \hat{I} \:,
\label{eq:reflect_r_hat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{B} =  \hat{I} - ( \hat{I} \cdot \hat{s} ) \hat{s} \:,
\label{eq:reflect_p_hat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{R} =  \hat{I} - 2 ( \hat{I} \cdot \hat{s} ) \hat{s} \:.
\label{eq:reflect_direction}
\end{equation}
For ocean surface reflections, these relationships negate the sign of the
radial component while leaving the \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) direction
components unchanged.

During development, we found that the Eq.~ (\ref{eq:reflect_direction}) was very sensitive to the curvature of the incident ray.  Using a second second order Taylor expansion for each component of the position,
normalized direction, and sound speed, to find their precise values at the point
defined by Eq. (\ref{eq:reflection_time_bottom}), improved the overall accuracy of the reflection model.

Most bottom depth databases grid the relief of the earth's surface into a
series of geographic latitude and longitude points. WaveQ3D compute the spherical components of the
surface normal (\( s_r, s_\theta, s_\phi\)) by equating the
slope (\(\sigma_\theta, \sigma_\phi\)) to the first derivative of $b$, the
bottom's radial position at the point of reflection.
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_\theta \equiv tan(\sigma_\theta) 
		= \frac{1}{b} \frac{db}{d\theta} \:,
	\label{eq:slope_theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_\phi \equiv tan(\sigma_\phi) 
		= \frac{1}{b \: sin\theta} \frac{db}{d\phi} \:,
	\label{eq:slope_phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	s_\theta = - sin(\sigma_\theta) 
		= -\frac{\Omega_\theta}{ \sqrt{1+\Omega^2_\theta} } \:,
	\label{eq:normal_theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	s_\phi = - sin(\sigma_\phi) 
		= -\frac{\Omega_\phi}{ \sqrt{1+\Omega^2_\phi} } \:,
	\label{eq:normal_phi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	s_r = \sqrt{ 1- ( s^2_\theta + s^2_\phi )} \:.
	\label{eq:normal_r}
\end{equation}

After reflection, WaveQ3D must re-initialize the ray in a way that maintains the
phase continuity of the wavefront. The WaveQ3D model uses a third order
Runge-Kutta (RK3) algorithm to reverse propagation from the point of
reflection back to the \(t_n\), \(t_{n-1}\), \(t_{n-2}\) points in time, during reinitialization.

\section{Finding Eigenrays using Coherent Wavefronts}

In the WaveQ3D model, eigenrays are derived from each target's geometry relative
to a Closest Point of Approach (CPA) on the wavefront. A point on the
wavefront is the CPA for a specific target if it has the smalled distance to that target
relative to the wavefront points immediately surround it. The coordinates for this distance calculation are illustrated
in Fig.~\ref{fig:eigenray_geometry}
where
\(\vec{r}_{p}\) is the position of the eigenray target;
\(\vec{r}_{njk}\) is the position of a candidate point on the wavefront;
\(d_{njk}\) is the distance from target to each point on wavefront;
\(\delta t\) is the target offset along the direction of propagation;
\(\delta\mu\) is the target offset in the depression/elevation direction; and 
\(\delta\varphi\) is the target offset in the azimuthal direction.
\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{EigenrayGeometry.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Eigenray estimation geometry 
		(side view: \(\varphi_k\) direction not shown).}
	\label{fig:eigenray_geometry}
\end{figure}

WaveQ3D uses an efficient calculation for the square of the distance in spherical
coordinates that is derived from the Haversine formula\cite{Sinnott1984}
\begin{equation}
	d^2_{njk} = r^2_{p} + r^2_{njk} - 2 \vec{r}_{p} \cdot \vec{r}_{njk} \:,
	\label{eq:pythagoras1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d^2_{njk} = r^2_{p} + r^2_{njk} - 2 r_{p} r_{njk}
	\left[ sin(\chi_{p}) sin(\chi_{ijk})
	+ cos(\chi_{p}) cos(\chi_{ijk}) cos(\phi_{p}-\phi_{ijk}) \right] \:,
	\label{eq:pythagoras2}
\end{equation}
\begin{align}
	d^2_{njk} &= r^2_{p} + r^2_{njk} - 2 r_{p} r_{njk}
	\left[ 1 - 2 \left\{ sin^2 \left( \frac{\chi_{p}-\chi_{ijk}}{2} \right) 
		\right.\right.\nonumber\\
	&\left.\left. {} + cos(\chi_{p}) cos(\chi_{ijk}) sin^2 
		\left( \frac{\phi_{p}-\phi_{ijk}}{2} \right) \right\} \right] \:,
\label{eq:haversine1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	d^2_{njk} &\approx r^2_{p} + r^2_{njk} - 2 r_{p} r_{njk}
	\left[ 1 - 2 \left\{ \left( \frac{\chi_{p}-\chi_{ijk}}{2} \right)^2 
		\right.\right.\nonumber\\
	&\left.\left. {} + cos(\chi_{p}) cos(\chi_{ijk}) 
		\left( \frac{\phi_{p}-\phi_{ijk}}{2} \right)^2 \right\} \right] \:,
	\label{eq:haversine2}
\end{align}
\begin{equation}
	d^2_{njk} \approx r^2_{p} + r^2_{njk} - 2 r_{p} r_{njk}
	\left[ 1 - 2 \left\{ \left( \frac{\theta_{p}-\theta_{ijk}}{2} \right)^2
		+ sin(\theta_{p}) sin(\theta_{ijk}) 
		\left( \frac{\phi_{p}-\phi_{ijk}}{2} \right)^2 \right\} \right] \:.
	\label{eq:haversine3}
\end{equation}

The accuracy of this approximation improves as the distance between the
target and the wavefront decreases. Because the implementation caches values for
\(sin\theta\) at both the wavefront and target locations,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:haversine3}) allows \(d^2_{njk}\) to be computed without the
use of any additional transcendental functions.

WaveQ3D uses the offset of each target relative to the travel time  (\(t\)),
depression/elevation launch angle (\(\mu\)), and the azimuthal launch
angle (\(\varphi\)) coordinates of the CPA to compute eigenrays.
The WaveQ3D model calculates these offsets by expressing \(d^2_{p}\), the square
of the distance at the target point, as a second
order Taylor series, relative to the CPA, in vector form
\begin{equation}
	\vec{\rho} \equiv (\rho_1, \rho_2, \rho_3) 
		\equiv (\delta t, \delta \mu, \delta \varphi) \:,
	\label{eq:rho_defined}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d^2_{p} \approx \epsilon + \vec{g} \cdot \vec{\rho} 
		+ \frac{1}{2} \vec{\rho} \cdot \mathbf{H} \: \vec{\rho} \:,
	\label{eq:taylor1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon  \equiv d^2 \big|_{CPA} \:,
	\label{eq:taylor2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{g} \equiv \frac{\partial d^2}{\partial \vec{\rho} } \big|_{CPA} \:,
	\label{eq:taylor3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{H} \equiv \frac{\partial^2 d^2}{\partial \vec{\rho}^2 } \big|_{CPA}
	\label{eq:taylor4}
\end{equation}
where 
\(\vec{\rho}\) is the target offset from CPA in vector form;
\(\vec{g}\) is the gradient of squared distance at CPA (3 elements), and
\(\mathbf{H}\) is the Hessian matrix of squared distance at CPA (3x3).

One way to solve this equation would be to search for a value of
\(\vec{\rho}\) for which Eq.~(\ref{eq:taylor1}) was zero. However, since
\(d^2_{p}\) is positive definite, the problem can be simplified by
searching for the minimum value, indicated by a zero in the first
derivative
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial d^2_{p}}{\partial \vec{\rho} } 
		= \vec{g} + \mathbf{H} \: \vec{\rho} = 0 \:,
	\label{eq:inverse1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{H} \: \vec{\rho} = -\vec{g} \:,
	\label{eq:inverse2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{\rho} = - \mathbf{H}^{-1} \: \vec{g} \:.
	\label{eq:inverse3}
\end{equation}

This treatment reduces the offset estimation problem to the calculation of
the gradient of distance, the calculation of the Hessian matrix, and a
matrix inversion. Note that the inverse of a 3x3 matrix has a simple
analytic solution that allows it to be solved efficiently and without
approximation.

Some eigenray products can be computed directly from this offset vector
solution
\begin{equation}
	t_p = t_n + \delta t \:,
	\label{eq:delta_t}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mu_p = \mu_j + \delta \mu \:,
	\label{eq:delta_mu}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\varphi_p = \varphi_k + \delta \varphi
	\label{eq:delta_varphi}
\end{equation}
where 
\(t_p\) is the travel time from the source;
\(\mu_p\) is the depression/elevation launch angle at source; and
\(\varphi_p\) is the azimuthal launch angle at source.
WaveQ3D computes the direction at the target  by forward solving a 2nd
order Taylor series for \(\vec\xi\) in the neighborhood of the CPA.  
The calculation of the eigenray is completed by the calculation of propagation loss, which is discussed in the next section.

Note that this eigenray detection process is less much efficient than an equivalent
calculation in Cartesian coordinates. The impact of this
difference is minimized when the number of targets is small compared to the
number ray tracing points; a good assumption for real-time, sonar
simulation/stimulation systems. Unfortunately, this assumption may make the WaveQ3D model
inefficient for tactical decision aids, because the number of target points
is large in "what-if" applications.

\section{Computing Propagation Loss using \threeD Gaussian beams}

In conventional ray theory, the spreading of acoustic propagation loss is estimated by
measuring the changes in ensonified area between ray paths. The intensity
across the wavefront is inversely proportional to the change in a surface
area segment compared to its area at the source. The Gaussian beam approach uses
dynamic ray equations to compute the divergence of the acoustic field
normal to the path of propagation. 
The GRAB model assumes that this divergence can be estimated from the wavefront
shape directly, and this reduces the computational cost of transmission loss calculations.

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{GaussianGeometry.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Gaussian ray nearest neighbors 
		(front view: \(t_n\) direction not shown).}
	\label{fig:ray_neighbors}
\end{figure}
In \twoD Gaussian beam models, the intensity at the target location is a summation of contributions from rays above and below the eigenray target. To extend this to three dimensions, WaveQ3D assumes that the wavefront spreading is independent in the \(\mu\) and \(\varphi\) directions. This assumption decomposes the Gaussian ray contributions to a series of nearest neighbor lines in the \(\mu\) and \(\varphi\) directions, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ray_neighbors}.
\begin{equation}
	G(\vec{r}_p) = \left( \sum_{j'=j-J}^{j+J} g_{j'}(\vec{r}_p)\right) 
		\left( \sum_{k'=k-K}^{k+K} g_{k'}(\vec{r}_p)\right) \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_sum}
\end{equation}
where
\(G(\vec{r}_p)\) is the total Gaussian beam intensity at the eigenray target;
$(j,k)$ are the index numbers of the cell containing the eigenray target;
\(g_{j'}\) are the Gaussian beam contributions along depression/elevation direction;
\(g_{k'}\) are the Gaussian beam contributions along the azimuthal direction;
$2J+1$ are the number of significant beams in the depression/elevation direction; and
$2K+1$ are the number of significant beams in the azimuthal direction.

The intensity of each Gaussian beam contribution is a function of the width
of the beam and the distance along the wavefront to the eigenray target,
normalized to the average distance across the beam at the source
\begin{equation}
	N_{j'} = \frac{ \int_{\varphi_{k'}}^{\varphi_{k'+1}} \left( \mu_{j'+1} - \mu_{j'} \right) d\varphi }
		{  \int_{\varphi_{k'}}^{\varphi_{k'+1}} d\varphi }
		= \mu_{j'+1} - \mu_{j'}
	\label{eq:gaussian_norm1} \:,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	 N_{k'}= \frac{ \int_{\mu_{j'}}^{\mu_{j'+1}} \left( \varphi_{k'+1} - \varphi_{k'} \right) cos \left( \mu \right) d\mu }
		{  \int_{\mu_{j'}}^{\mu_{j'+1}} d\mu }
		= \frac{ sin(\mu_{j'+1}) - sin(\mu_{j'}) }{\mu_{j'+1}-\mu_{j'}}
		\left( \varphi_{k'+1} - \varphi_{k'} \right)  \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_norm2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	g_{j'}(\vec{r}_p) = \frac{N_{j'}}{\sqrt{2\pi w^2_{j'}}} 
		\: exp \left( - \frac{d^2_{j'}}{2w^2_{j'}} \right) \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_each1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	g_{k'}(\vec{r}_p) = \frac{ N_{k'} }{\sqrt{2\pi w^2_{k'}}} 
		\: exp \left( - \frac{d^2_{k'}}{2w^2_{k'}} \right) \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_each2}
\end{equation}
where
\(w_{j'}\) and \(w_{k'}\) are the half-widths of the Gaussian beam (from the cell
center to one edge) in the \(\mu\) and \(\varphi\) directions; and
\(d^2_{j'}\) and \(d^2_{k'}\) are the distance in the \(\mu\) and \(\varphi\)
directions from the Gaussian beam center to the eigenray target. 

The WaveQ3D model aligns the ray paths with the edges of the Gaussian beam (full-width at half maximum).  Distance terms in the \(\mu\) direction are calculated using the following pattern
\begin{equation}
	L = 2 \: w_j \: \frac{\delta \mu}{\Delta \mu_j} \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_width1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_j = L - w_j \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_width2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_{j-1} = L - w_{j-1} \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_width3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_{j-2} = L + 2 w_{j-1} + w_{j-2} \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_width4}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_{j+1} = L - 2 w_j - w_{j+1} \:,
	\label{eq:gaussian_width5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	d_{j+2} = L - 2 w_j - w_{j+1} - w_{j+2}
	\label{eq:gaussian_width6}
\end{equation}
where
\(\delta \mu\) is the eigenray offset in depression/elevation angle;
\(\Delta \mu\) is the depression/elevation width of this beam at the source;
\(w_j\) is the width of beam $j$;
and all widths have been interpolated to the time \(t_n+\delta t\).
More distant cells can be supported by adding additional $2w$ terms to
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:gaussian_width4}) and (\ref{eq:gaussian_width6}). The pattern
in the azimuthal direction is similar.

GRAB\cite{Weinberg1996} models the frequency dependent component of the
beamwidth by giving each beam a minimum width
\begin{equation}
  w'_j(f) = max \left( w_j, 2 \pi \lambda \right) \:, 
  \label{eq:weinberg_width}
\end{equation}
where 
\(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the signal being modeled;
\(w_j\) is the cell width of beam $j$, and
\(w'_j(f)\) is the adjusted width of beam $j$.
The \(\lambda\) term acts as the minimum amount of spreading that GRAB expects beams to project into neighboring areas.  In GRAB, Gaussian beams are overlapped by 50\% to reduce fluctuations in the vicinity of the mid-point between rays.\cite{Weinberg1996b}  The number of Gaussian profiles is effectively twice the number of ray paths. 

The WaveQ3D model treats beam width broadening as a convolution between a
frequency dependent Gaussian propagation spread and a second Gaussian that
represents the spatial spreading created by the sampling of the wavefront.
\begin{equation}
	(w'_j(f))^2 = \left( 2 w_j \right)^2 + \left( 2 \pi \lambda \right)^2 \:.
	\label{eq:new_width}
\end{equation}
which avoids the sudden transitions inherent in taking a maximum value.
WaveQ3D manages the 50\% overlap by multiplying the cell width term by two.  Treating the two spreading terms in this way reduces the number of Gaussian beam calculations by two,  Normalizing
Eq.~(\ref{eq:gaussian_each1}) by the combined effect of both spreading sources conserves energy across the wavefront.

During development, we evaluated the impact of these changes on propagation into a shadow zone using the downward refracting n\textsuperscript{2} linear environment used in the development of GRAB's minimum beamwidth.
\begin{equation}
	c(z) = \cfrac{c_0}{\sqrt{1+\cfrac{2 g_0 z}{c_0}}} \:,
	\label{eq:n2_linear}
\end{equation}
where
\(c(z)\) is speed of sound as a function of depth;
\(z\) is depth (positive is down);
\(c_0\) is the speed of sound at the ocean surface (=1550.0~m/s); and
\(g_0\) is the sound speed gradient at the ocean surface
(=1.2~s\textsuperscript{-1}).

Because analytic results for this scenario did not include the effects of a round Earth, an Earth flattening correction needed to be applied to the sound speed profile before WaveQ3D could generate equivalent results.  The Earth flattening term is the inversion of the term used by GRAB to incorporate Earth curvature into its calculations.\cite{Pekeris1946} This correction is given by
\begin{equation}
	c(r) = \frac{r}{R} \: c(z) \:, 
	\label{eq:n2_correction}
\end{equation}
where
$r$ is the radial distance from the center of curvature;
$R$ is the radius of earth's curvature in this area of operations;
$c(z)$ is the original sound speed; and
$c(r)$ is the modified sound speed.

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=4in]{pedersen_shallow_compare.eps}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Model comparisons at edge of shadow zone. \label{fig:n2_shallow}}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:n2_shallow} compares the results of WaveQ3D, GRAB, and a full field calculation using the Fast Field Program (FFP) wavenumber integration model.\cite{DiNapoli1980,Brekhovskikh1980}  
It  plots the coherent propagation loss, as a function of range, for a continuous ensonification at 2000 Hz, with the source and receiver both at a depth of 75 meters.  Note that, at all ranges, the FFP result is consistent with an ideal wave equation solution except for the presence of some minor implementation jitter in the ranges above 880~m.  Prior to the shadow zone, all three models produce similar results. In the region beyond 840~m, the WaveQ3D and GRAB transmission loss values are similar to each other, but slightly higher than FFP. This result, in combination with other tests that we have performend, suggests that our \threeD implementation of GRAB's \twoD Gaussian beam appears to produce equivalent results.

\section{Execution Speed Comparisons}

The premise of the WaveQ3D approach is that, when target/sensor geometries are constantly evolving, it is more computationally efficient to perform acoustic transmission loss (TL) in the latitude, longitude, altitude coordinates of the underlying environmental databases, than it is to convert the \threeD environments into a series of 2-DxN Cartesian slices. Testing this claim requires a scenario that combines the extraction of data from a \threeD data set and the calculation of transmission loss for a large number of targets.  Fortunately, one of the regressions tests that are distributed with GRAB includes just such a combination of features.  Although the speeds of individual training systems will differ from this example (because they each extract \twoD radials in a different way) this scenario provides a useful baseline for evaluating the potential of the WaveQ3D approach.

Standard Test 14 was modified to compute transmission loss for a variable number of targets, at a depth of 100 m, and a range 100 km from the source, evenly spaced in azimuth. This test includes a grid of sound speeds and bottom depths in latitude and longitude coordinates for an area near Hawaii, between 16.2N-24.6N and 164.7W-155.4W. The source location was SW of Hawaii at 19.52N 160.5W, at a depth of 200 m.  For CASS a radial was constructed for each target using a depression/elevation ray fan of +89 to -89 by 1 degree increments and the range of each target in each radial of 100 km. For WaveQ3D, a wavefront was constructed using depression/elevation angles from -90 to +90 of 181 tangentially spaced rays and an azimuthal spread from 0 to 360 using 25 evenly spaced rays. WaveQ3D propagates 4525 rays through the environment for 80 seconds by 100 millisecond time steps. 

\begin{figure}[th]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=4in]{std14_timing_test.pdf}} 
	\vspace*{8pt}
	\caption{Speed of transmission loss calculation. \label{fig:std14_timing_test}}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:n2_shallow} illustrates timing tests of the relative speeds of the models, run on a Dell Latitude Laptop E6520 Intel i5-2540M CPU @2.60GHz, with a variable number of targets from 0 to 100 targets, in increments of 10. The ordinal axis illustrates the time required to compute transmission loss for all targets on this platform.  The GRAB model requires approximately 476 ms per target.  The measured speed of WaveQ3D is approximately 3.07 seconds plus 42 ms per target.  For small numbers of targets, GRAB is faster, because WaveQ3D must propagate the wavefront in all directions for 80 seconds, regardless of the number of targets.  GRAB only needs to construct \twoD radials if a target is actually present.  However, as the number of targets grows large, WaveQ3D is faster because it has a much less overhead on a per target basis.  The crossover point for this scenario appears to be approximately 7 targets.  Although WaveQ3D may not be more computationally efficient than other models in all applications, these results illustrate its potential to make a significant speed improvement in active sonar simulation/stimulation systems where the number of targets is large.
