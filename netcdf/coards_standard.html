</p><h2><a name="rev2_issue13">Relationship to other Standards:</a></h2><p>
This standard is a set of conventions adopted in order to promote the
interchange and sharing of files created with the netCDF Application
Programmer Interface (API).  This standard is based upon version 2.3
of netCDF.  Documentation of the netCDF API may be found in the
<cite>"NetCDF Users' Guide, Version 2.3</cite>, April 1993 available
from URL <cite> http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</cite> or
via anonymous ftp at ftp.unidata.ucar.edu.  All conventions named in that
document will be adhered to in this standard unless noted to the
contrary.</p><p>

<a name="rev2_issue1">This standard also refers to version 1.7.1 of
the udunits standard supported by Unidata</a>.  The udunits package is
available via anonymous ftp at ftp.unidata.ucar.edu.  Included in the
udunits package is a file, udunits.dat, which lists collections of unit
names.  The names given therein and their plural forms will be
regarded as acceptable unit names for this standard with the following
additions and deletions:</p><ul>
	<li>"degrees" - deleted
	</li><li>"level", "layer", "sigma_level" - added
</li></ul>
The unit "degrees" creates ambiguities when attempting to
differentiate longitude and latitude coordinate variables; files must
use "degrees_east" for units of longitude and "degrees_north" for
units of latitude or the alternative "spellings" of those names listed
in the sections on longitude and latitude coordinates below.  The
dimensionless units "level", "layer", and "sigma_level" are sometimes
needed when representing numerical model outputs.<p>

The udunits package also supports linear transformation of all units
through the syntax "scale_factor unit_name@offset", for example,
"0.0005 degC@40000".  This syntax, however, is not supported by this
standard.</p><p>

These conventions have been registered with Unidata as
the <b>COARDS</b> conventions and are available at <cite>ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/Conventions/COARDS</cite>

</p><p></p><hr><p>

</p><h2>Conventions:</h2><p>

<strong>File Name:</strong><br>
NetCDF files should have the file name extension ".nc".
</p><p>
<strong>Coordinate Variables:</strong> <br>
1-dimensional netCDF variables whose dimension names are identical to
their variable names are regarded as "coordinate variables" (axes of
 the underlying grid structure of other variables defined on this
dimension).</p><p>

<strong>Global attributes:</strong> <br>
Although not mandatory the attribute "history" is recommended to
record the evolution of the data contained within a netCDF file.
Applications which process netCDF data can append their information to
the history attribute.</p><p>

The optional attribute "Conventions" is recommended to reference the
COARDS conventions, registered with Unidata, and available via ftp at
</p><p></p><pre>   directory:      pub/netcdf/Conventions/COARDS
   host:           ftp.unidata.ucar.edu
</pre><p>
  The attribute has this value:</p><p>
</p><pre>  :Conventions = "COARDS";
  // Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service
</pre>
<p>

<strong><a name="rev2_issue5">Data Variable attributes:</a></strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>long_name</strong> - a long descriptive name (title). This could
be used for labelling plots, for example.  If a variable has no long_name
attribute assigned, the variable name will be used as a default. 
</li><li><strong>scale_factor</strong> - If present for a variable, the data are
to be multiplied by this factor after the data are read by the application
that accesses the data. (see further discussion under the add_offset attribute)

</li><li><strong>add_offset</strong> - If present for a variable, this
number is to be added to the data after it is read by the application
that accesses the data. If both scale_factor and add_offset attributes
are present, the data are first scaled before the offset is added. The
attributes scale_factor and add_offset can be used together to provide
simple data compression to store low-resolution floating-point data as
small integers in a netCDF file. When scaled data are written, the
application should first subtract the offset and then divide by the
scale factor.<br>
The NOAA cooperative standard is more restrictive than the netCDF
Users Guide with respect to the use of the scale_factor and add_offset
attributes; ambiguities and precision problems related to data type
conversions are resolved by these restrictions.  If the scale_factor
and add_offset attributes are of the same data type as the associated
variable no restrictions apply; the unpacked data is assumed to be of
the same data type as the packed data.  However, if the scale_factor
and add_offset attributes are of a different data type than the
associated variable (containing the packed data) then in files
adhering to this standard the associated variable may only be of type
byte, short, or long.  The attributes scale_factor and add_offset
(which must match in data type) must be of type float or double.  The
data type of the attributes should match the intended type of the
unpacked data.  (It is not advised to unpack a long into a float as
there is a potential precision loss.)

</li><li><strong>_FillValue </strong> - If a scalar attribute with this
name is defined for a variable and is of the same type as the
variable, it will be subsequently used as the fill value for that
variable. The purpose of this attribute is to save the applications
programmer the work of prefilling the data and also to eliminate the
duplicate writes that result from netCDF filling in missing data with
its default fill value, only to be immediately overwritten by the
programmer's preferred value. This value is considered to be a special
value that indicates missing data, and is returned when reading values
that were not written. The missing value should be outside the range
specified by valid_range (if used) for a variable. It is not necessary
to define your own _FillValue attribute for a variable if the default
fill value for the type of the variable is adequate.  

</li><li><strong>missing_value</strong> - missing_value is a conventional
name for a missing value that will not be treated in any special way
by the library, as the _FillValue attribute is. It is also useful when
it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of missing
values. <a name="rev2_issue3">The
netCDF data type of the
missing_value attribute should match the netCDF data type of the data
variable that it describes. In cases where the data variable is packed
via the scale_value attribute this implies that the missing_value flag
is
likewise packed. The same holds for the _FillValue attribute.</a>
  <a name="rev2_issue2"> The NOAA cooperative standard does not endorse
any particular interpretation of the distinction between missing_value
and _FillValue.</a><br>

</li></ul><p>


<strong>Units attribute:</strong><br>
A character array that specifies the units used for the variable's
data.  Where possible the units attribute should be formatted as per
the recommendations in the Unidata udunits package.
</p><p>

<strong>Other attributes:</strong> <br>
A file will normally contain many attributes that are not standardized
in this profile.  Those attributes do not represent a violation of
this standard in any way.  Application programs should ignore
attributes that they do not recognize.</p><p>

<strong>Variable names:</strong><br>
Variable names should begin with a letter and be composed of letters,
digits, and underscores.  <a name="rev2_issue8">It is recommended
that variable names be case-insensitive</a> implying that the same
case-insensitive name should not be used for multiple variables within
a single file.</p><p>

<strong>Rectilinear coordinate systems, only:</strong><br>
The space/time locations of points within the netCDF variables
should be the simple ordered tuples formed by associating values from
their coordinate axes.  Thus, for example, curvilinear coordinate
systems in which the coordinate locations must be inferred from other
non-coordinate variables or from an equation are not standardized
by this netCDF profile.</p><p>

<strong>Number of dimensions:</strong><br>
All netCDF variables will be defined on either one, two ,three, or
four dimensions (the nature of the data will dictate the natural
encoding).  Where it makes sense single point locations should be
encoded as coordinate variables, for example, the latitude and
longitude positions of a vertical profile are natural candidates for
single point latitude and longitude coordinate variables.<br>
  <a name="rev2_issue6">If it is necessary to create a netCDF file
with more than 4 dimensions </a>it is recommended that the additional
dimension(s) be added "to the left" of the space and time dimensions
as represented in CDL.  For example
</p><pre>	float my_variable(param_value,time,height,lat,lon);  </pre>
would be
the recommended representation of a fifth, parameter value,
coordinate.
<p>

<strong>Coordinate variable names:</strong><br>
The names of coordinate variables are not standardized by these
conventions (since data sets may in general contain multiple
coordinate variables of the same orientation).  Coordinate variable
names should follow the same general naming rules (above) as other netCDF
variables.</p><p>

<strong>Order of dimensions:</strong><br>
If any or all of the dimensions of a variable have the
interpretations of "date or time" (a.k.a. "T"), "height or depth"
(a.k.a. "Z"), "latitude" (a.k.a. "Y"), or "longitude" (a.k.a. "X") then
those dimensions should appear in the relative order T, then Z, then
Y, then X in the CDL definition corresponding to the file.</p><p>

<strong>Data type:</strong><br>
The data type of coordinate and non-coordinate variables is
unrestricted (byte, short, long, float, and double are all acceptable
data types).<a name="rev2_issue10"> Although not forbidden by this
standard the data type "char", which is functionally identical to
"byte", is not recommended as netCDF has reserved the option to modify
its behavior in future versions.</a>
</p><p>
<strong>Coordinate value ordering:</strong><br>
The coordinate values of a coordinate variable must be either
monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.  However, the
coordinate values need not be evenly spaced.  Missing values are not permitted in coordinate variables.</p><p>

<strong><a name="rev2_issue4">Coordinate Variable
Attributes:</a></strong><br> If a coordinate variable contains
longitude, latitude, depth, elevation, date, or time values then the
units attribute is mandatory; it is used to determine the orientation
of the coordinate variable.  The long_name attribute is optional but
may be used to enhance clarity and the self-describing nature of the
netCDF file.  Since coordinate variables may not contain missing
values the attributes _FillValue and missing_value may not be used
with coordinate variables.</p><p>

<strong>Time or date dimension:</strong><br>
Coordinate variables representing time must always explicitly include
the units attribute;  there is no default value.
A time coordinate variable will be identifiable by its units, alone.
The units attribute will be of character type with the string formatted
as per the recommendations in the Unidata udunits package version 1.7.1.
  The following
excerpt from the udunits documentation explains the time unit
encoding by example:</p><p>

  <tt>The specification:</tt></p><p>

<tt>       seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00</tt></p><p>

<tt>  indicates seconds since October 8th, 1992 at 3 hours, 15 minutes and 42.5
  seconds in the afternoon in the time zone which is six hours to the west of
  Coordinated Universal Time (i.e. Mountain Daylight Time).  The time zone
  specification can also be written without a colon using one or two-digits
  (indicating hours) or three or four digits (indicating hours and minutes).
  </tt></p><p>

The acceptable units for time are listed in the file udunits.dat.  The
most commonly used of these strings (and their abbreviations) includes
day (d), hour (hr, h), minute (min), second (sec, s), year
(yr). Plural forms are also acceptable.  The date string may include
date alone; date and time; or date, time, and time zone. <br>
It is recommended that the unit "year" not be used as a unit of time.
Year is an ambiguous unit as years are of varying length.  Udunits
defines a year as exactly 365 days. </p><p>

A time coordinate variable is identifiable from its units string,
alone.  The udunits routines utScan and utIsTime can be used to make
this determination.  (*Note that at the time of this writing the
author of this draft profile had not tested these routines
personally.)</p><p>

<strong>Climatological time:</strong><br>
Coordinate variables representing
climatological time (an axis of 12 months, 4 seasons, etc. that is
located in no particular year) should be encoded like other time axes
but with the added restriction that they be encoded to begin in the
year 0000.  (Note - at the time of this writing this encoding has not been
 tested with the udunits package.)</p><p>

<strong>Vertical (height or depth) dimension:</strong><br>
Coordinate variables representing height or depth must
always explicitly include the units attribute; there is no default
value for the units attribute. The units attribute will be of
character type.</p><p>

The acceptable units for vertical (depth or height) coordinate
variables are 
</p><ul>
<li>units of pressure as listed in the file udunits.dat.  For
vertical axes the most commonly used of these include 
include bar, millibar, decibar, and atmosphere (atm).
</li><li>units of length as listed in the file udunits.dat.  For
vertical axes the most commonly used of these include meter (metre, m), centimeter (cm), decimeter (dm), and feet (ft).
</li><li> the (dimensionless) units "level", "layer", or "sigma_level"
</li><li> other units listed in the file udunits.dat that may under certain
circumstances reference vertical position such as units of density or
temperature.
</li></ul>

Plural forms are also acceptable.<p>

The direction of positive, whether up or down, cannot in all cases be
inferred from the units.  The direction of positive is useful for
applications displaying the data.  For this reason the new attribute
<cite>positive</cite> is defined in this standard.  The inclusion of
the <cite>positive</cite> attribute is required by this standard if
the vertical axis units are not a valid unit of pressure (a
determination which can be made using the udunits routine, utScan) --
otherwise its inclusion is optional.  The <cite>positive</cite>
attribute may have the value "up" or "down" (case insensitive).</p><p>

For example, if an oceanographic netCDF file encodes the depth of
the surface as 0 and the depth of 1000 meters as 1000 then the axis
would use attributes as follows:</p><p>
<tt>
	axis_name:units="meters";  <br>
	axis_name:positive="down"; </tt></p><p><tt> 
</tt>
If, on the other hand, the depth of 1000 meters were represented as
-1000 then the value of the <cite>positive</cite> attribute would have
been "up".  If the units attribute value is a valid pressure unit the
default value of the <cite>positive</cite> attribute is "down".</p><p>

A vertical coordinate variable will be identifiable by
</p><ul>
<li>units of pressure; or
</li><li> the presence of the <cite>positive</cite> attribute with a value of "up"
or "down" (case insensitive).
</li></ul>

<strong>Latitude dimension:</strong><br>
Coordinate variables representing latitudes must always explicitly include
 the units attribute; there is no default value for the units
attribute.  The units attribute will be of character
type with the string formatted as per the recommendations in the
Unidata udunits package.<p>

The recommended unit of latitude is "degrees_north".  Also acceptable
are "degree_north", "degree_N", and "degrees_N".</p><p>

A latitude coordinate variable is identifiable from its units string,
alone.  The udunits routines utScan can be used to make this
determination.  (Note that at the time of this writing the author of
this draft profile had not tested these routines personally.)</p><p>


<strong>Longitude dimension:</strong><br>
Coordinate variables representing longitudes must always explicitly
include the units attribute; there is no default value for the units
attribute.  The units attribute will be of character type with the
string formatted as per the recommendations in the Unidata udunits
package. </p><p>

The recommended unit of longitude is "degrees_east" (eastward
positive).  Also acceptable are "degree_east", "degree_E", and
"degrees_E".  <a name="rev2_issue12">The unit "degrees_west"</a>
(westward positive) is not recommended because it implies a negative
conversion factor from degrees_east.</p><p>

Longitudes may be represented modulo 360.  Thus, for example, -180,
180, and 540 are all valid representations of the International
Dateline and 0 and 360 are both valid representations of the Prime
Meridian. Note, however, that the sequence of numerical longitude
 values stored in the netCDF file must be monotonic in a
non-modulo sense. </p><p>

A longitude coordinate variable is identifiable from its units string,
alone.  The udunits routines utScan can be used to make this
determination.  (Note that at the time of this writing the author of
this draft profile had not tested these routines personally.)</p><p>
