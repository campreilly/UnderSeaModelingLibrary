/**
 * Extracts bathymetry data from world-wide bathymetry databases.
 * Stores the latitude, longitude, and depth in spherical earth
 * coordinates for faster interpolation within the WaveQ3D model.
 * This choice of coordinates means that the latitude, longitude axes
 * are actually stored in the form of a colatitude and azimuth in radians.
 * Because these databases store their data such that latitudes area increasing,
 * the co-latitude axis starts from it's largest value, and then uses
 * a negative increment to sequence down to its smallest value.  In other words,
 * the data appear to be "upside-down" in spherical earth coordinates.
 *
 * The variables to be loaded are deduced by their dimensionality.
 * The first variable to have 2 dimensions is assumed to be depth.
 * Negative depth values in netCDF file are taken to be under water.
 * Assumes that the dataset supports the COARDS conventions for
 * the standardization of NetCDF files.
 *
 * - The first dimension of the depth is assumed to be latitude.
 * - The second dimension of the depth is assumed to be longitude.
 *   This implementation automatically unwraps differences between
 *   the [0,360) and the [-180,180) longitude range.
 *
 * This may seem like a pretty loose specification, but this looseness is very
 * helpful in automating the reading NetCDF files from a variety of sources.
 *
 * Successfully tested using ETOPO1, ETOPO2, and ETOPO5 data:
 * - ETOPO1 grid/node-registered ice surface data. Grid of Earth's surface
 *   depicting the top of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
 *   Cells are centered on lines of latitude and longitude.
 * - ETOPO2 gridline registered, with cell boundaries defined by lines
 *   of odd minutes of latitude and longitude.
 * - ETOPO5 5-minute gridded elevations/bathymetry for the world.
