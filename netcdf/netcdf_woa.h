/**
 * Extracts ocean profile data from World Ocean Atlas (WOA).
 * The World Ocean Atlas defines worldwide physical characteristics, like
 * temperature and salinity for monthly, seasonal, and annual averages.
 * All of these products uses a standard set of depths:
 *
 * - Depth: 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300,
 *   400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500,
 *   1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500 meters.
 *
 * This class is a specialization of the netcdf_profile class that allows
 * monthly average to be constructed over the entire range from 0 to 5500 by
 * splicing shallow monthly averages into either the deep seasonal average or
 * the deep yearly average. Seasonal average are recommended over yearly
 * averages for this splicing process.
 *
 * WOA dates are given in terms of days since the start of the year for the
 * middle of each month.  The date closest to the desired date is
 * considered the best match.  In WOA09, the exact dates used for each
 * of the products are:
 *
 * - Monthly: 15, 46, 75, 106, 136, 167, 197, 228, 259, 289, 320, 350 days.
 * - Seasonal: 46, 136, 228, 320 days.
 * - Yearly: 182 days.
 *
 * WOA latitude and longitudes are given relative to the center of the cell
 * in which they apply.  Latitudes are gridded at a 1 degree spacing from
 * -89.5 to 89.5 degrees.  Longitudes are gridded at a 1 degree spacing from
 * 0.5 to 359.5 degrees.
 *
 * Successfully tested using objectively analyzed climatologies for the
 * World Ocean Atlas 2009 and 2005 data sets. The WOA09 filenames for
 * the 1 degree version of each of these products take the form:
 *
 * - xxx_monthly_1deg.nc = Monthly averages for depths in the [0,1500] meter
 * range.
 * - xxx_seasonal_1deg.nc = Seasonal averages for depths in the [0,5500] meter
 * range.
 * - xxx_annual_1deg.nc = Yearly averages for depths in the [0,5500] meter
 * range.
 *
 * where xxx = "salinity" or "temperature", and the analyzed climatologies
 * are the first 4-D grid (s_an or t_an). The WOA05 filenames for each of
 * the analyzed climatologies take the form:
 *
 * - x0112an1.nc = Monthly averages for depths in the [0,1500] meter range.
 * - x1316an1.nc = Seasonal averages for depths in the [0,5500] meter range.
 * - x00an1.nc = Yearly averages for depths in the [0,5500] meter range.
 *
 * where x = "s" for salinity or "t" for temperature.
