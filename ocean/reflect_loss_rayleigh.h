/**
 * Models bottom loss from a flat fluid-solid interface. Includes the effects of both compression and shear waves in the bottom.
 * This model is only used for bottom reflection.
 * Note that the Rayleigh model is frequency independent because
 * all of the frequency terms cancel out.
 *
 * The effect of attenuation is incorporated into the model as
 * a complex component of the sound speed:
 * \f[
 *          c_w = c_{rw}
 * \f]\f[
 *          c_b = c_{rb}-i \frac{ \alpha_b c_{rb}^2 }{ \omega }
 * \f]\f[
 *          \alpha_b = \frac{ \alpha_{\lambda b} }{ \lambda_b 20 \log{e} }
 * \f]
 * where:
 *   - \f$ c_n        \f$ = complex sound speed in medium "n" (m/s)
 *   - \f$ c_{rn}     \f$ = real component of sound speed in medium "n" (m/s)
 *   - \f$ \alpha_{\lambda b} \f$ = attenuation coefficient in (dB/wavelength)
 *   - \f$ \lambda_b  \f$ = wavelength in bottom = \f$ c_{rb} / f \f$
 *   - \f$ \alpha_b   \f$ = attenuation coefficient in bottom (nepers/meter)
 *
 * The effect of absorption on the in-water sound speed is
 * assumed to be negligible.
 *
 * The complex reflection coefficient is modeled as a combination of
 * the acoustic impedances for compressional and shear waves.
 * The effect of shear on the in-water impedance is assumed to be negligible.
 * \f[
 *          Z_{pn} = \frac{ \rho_n c_n }{ cos(\theta_{pn}) }
 * \f]\f[
 *          Z_{sb} = \frac{ \rho_b c_{sb} }{ cos(\theta_{sb}) }
 * \f]\f[
 *          Z_w = Z_{pw}
 * \f]\f[
 *          Z_b = Z_{pb} sin^2(2\theta_{sn}) + Z_{sb} cos^2(2\theta_{sn})
 * \f]\f[
 *          R = \frac{ Z_b - Z_w }{ Z_b + Z_w }
 * \f]
 * where:
 *   - \f$ \rho_n  \f$ = density of medium "n" (kg/m^3)
 *   - \f$ c_{sb}  \f$ = complex shear speed in bottom (m/s)
 *   - \f$ \theta_{pn} \f$ = angle between ray and surface normal
 *          in medium "n" for compression waves (radians)
 *   - \f$ \theta_{sn} \f$ = angle between ray and surface normal
 *          in bottom for shear waves (radians)
 *   - \f$ Z_{pn}  \f$ = compression waves impedance in medium "n"
 *   - \f$ Z_{sn}  \f$ = shear wave impedance in bottom
 *   - \f$ Z_n     \f$ = total acoustic impedance in medium "n"
 *   - \f$ R       \f$ = complex reflection coefficient
 *
 * The angles between the ray and surface normal in each medium is
 * computed using Snell's Law:
 * \f[
 *      \frac{sin(\theta_w)}{c_w} =
 *      \frac{sin(\theta_{pb})}{c_{pb}} =
 *      \frac{sin(\theta_{sb})}{c_{sb}}
 * \f]
 *
 * Note that the sin() and cos() terms in this derivation have been
 * inverted from the reference to take into account the difference
 * between grazing angle and angle to the surface normal.
