/**
 * Pierson and Moskowitz model for computing wave height from wind speed.
 * This is an empirical model based on measurements of waves measured
 * on British weather ships in the north Atlantic.  It assumes that the waves 
 * have come into equilibrium with the wind over a large area.
 * This is the concept is called a fully developed sea.
 *
 * \f[
 *   	H_{1/3} \approx 0.22 \frac{ U_{10}^2 }{g}
 *
 *   	H_{rms} = \frac{1}{4} H_{1/3} \approx 0.0056 \: U_{10}^2
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f$ U_{10} \f$ = average wind speed measured at 10 meters above water (m/s),
 * \f$ g \approx 9.8 \: m/s^2 \f$ = acceleration due to gravity,
 * \f$ H_{1/3} \f$ = significant wave height (m), and
 * \f$ H_{rms} \f$ = root mean squared of wave height (m).
