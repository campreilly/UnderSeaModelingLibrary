% TL_STATS  Analyzes the differences between two transmission loss models.
%
% [bias,err,detcoef] = tl_stats(range1,level1,range2,level2,threshold) 
%
% The model to be tested is level1, in dB, as a function of range1. The
% model to be tested against is level2, in dB, as a function of range2.
% This implementation interpolates level1 to estimates its values on the
% range2 grid. The range of values can be easily limited by limiting the
% scope of the range2 input. This implementation also clips the minimum
% level of both models to the threshold. This clipping prevents us from
% basing most of the statistics on the differences between very quiet
% sounds.  If no threshold is provided, a default value of -100 dB is used.
%
% The bias measures the average amount that the level1 differs from level2
% in dB.  Since the difference of the mean is equal to the mean of the
% differences (dL).
%
%       bias = mean( dL ) 
%
% The deviation (dev) is a measure of the difference in flucuations of level3
% compared to level1.  Computed indirectly from the mean of dL^2.
%
%       dev = sqrt( mean( dL^2 ) - bias^2 ) 
%
% The coefficient of determination (detcoef) is a measure of the fraction
% of level2 that is predicts level1.  To allow for the fact that the best
% correlation may have a range offset, the coefficient of determination is
% computed from the maximum covariance as a function of lag.  To use
% matlab's xcov() and cov() functions for this calculation, we must make
% sure that they all use the normalization.
%
%                   cov(L1,L2)^2
%       detcoef = ----------------- * 100%
%                  cov(L1) cov(L2)
