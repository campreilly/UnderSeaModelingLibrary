/**
 * Task that executes in the #thread_pool. The typical use is:
 *
 * - The developer defines a new class that inherits from thread_task.
 * - The sub-class overloads the run() method in the new class,
 *   and adds any methods needed to configure the task.
 * - The developer dynamically creates a pointer to a new instance of
 *   the sub-class using "new".
 * - The developer calls any configure methods needed on the new instance.
 * - The developer passes the thread_task pointer to a new instance to
 *   thread_pool::run().  A shared pointer to the task is returned.
 * - The shared pointer is used to invoke the abort() method if there is a need
 *   to pre-maturely abort this task.  The developers code monitors the
 *   _abort flag to detect when abort() has been invoked.
 *
 * Automatically assigns an identification number for each task when it is
 * created. Sub-classes are responsible for catching their own exceptions.
 * Exceptions that are not caught by the sub-class are ignored.
 * This prevents uncaught exceptions from crashing the thread_pool.
