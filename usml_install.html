    <title>Building and Testing USML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Building and Testing the Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.
    </p>

    <p>USML depends on the NetCDF package, for access to test data, 
       and the Boost package, for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit test utilities.
       Correctly configuring these packages is the #1 problem reported by USML users.
       Before you attempt to build and test USML, please read these instructions carefully.

    <h2>Linux using GNU C++ and Unix Makefiles</h2>

    We've tested this process with:
    <ul>
	<li> 64-bit CentOS 6.6 with gcc 4.4.7 
    </ul>
    The steps that follow are the process we used to setup USML for a 64-bit CentOS 6 development environment.
    We expect your environment to be a little different, but this should get you started.
    Since CentOS is derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, 
    (see <a href="http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq">http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq</a>)
    we expect this process to work identically in RHEL6.
    <ul>
    <li> Download the source code distribution for USML
	<ul>
	<li> Extract USML from the distribution media.  On Linux, these consist of
	<pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.#.#.tar.gz
	</pre>
	     where #.#.# is the version number to be installed.  
	     In this example, we'll extract them to <code>~/Projects</code>, and this
	     creates a directory called <code>~/Projects/usml</code>
	<li> The USML build process absolutely requires the top-level USML directory 
	     to be named <code>usml</code>.  If you are extracting the code from another
	     source, such as GitHub, make sure to rename the base directory <code>usml</code>.
	</ul>
    <li> Install CMake 2.8 and NetCDF 4.1 RPMs from the CentOS yum servers
	<pre>
	sudo yum install cmake-gui netcdf-devel
	</pre>
    <li> Download and install the source code distribution for NCO 3.9.9
	<ul>
        <li> This library provides the NCKS utility that we use in many of our NetCDF regression tests.
	<li> We used the source code distribution called <code>nco-3.9.9.tar.gz</code> from 
	     <a href="http://nco.sourceforge.net/src/">http://nco.sourceforge.net/src/</a> 
	<li> To install this software in <code>/usr/local</code>
	<pre>
	cd path/to/nco-3.9.9
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	</pre>
	</ul>
    <li> Install Boost library from RPM or source.
	<ul>
	<li>You can install Boost 1.41 RPMs from the CentOS yum servers, if it is not installed already.
	<pre>
	sudo yum install boost-devel boost-static
	</pre>
	<li> Or, you can download newer Boost versions as source code.
	     We tested this with the distribution called <code>boost_1_57_0.tar.gz</code> from 
	     <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.57.0">
	     http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.57.0</a> and the
	     install instructions from <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html">
	     http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html</a>.
  	     To install this software in <code>/usr/local</code>, these instructions boil down to
	<pre>
	cd path/to/boost_1_57_0
	./bootstrap.sh
	b2
	sudo b2 install
	</pre>
	<li> In either case, there is a bug in the Boost uBLAS library that vector and matrix 
	     scaling using <code>operator/()</code>.  To see the corrected version of this code, please search for the 
	     symbol BOOST_UBLAS_CHECK_DIVISION_TYPE in the <code>vector_expression.hpp</code> 
	     and <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code> files in the <code>usml/config</code> directory.
	     In each case, the operator/() should be using the enable_if<> macros just like the operator*() 
	     just above it. Those using Boost 1.41 trhough 1.56 can just replace the original files with the
	     ones from the <code>usml/config</code> directory.  Boost 1.57 fixed the problem in 
	     <code>vector_expression.hpp</code>, but requires replacing <code>matrix_expression.hpp</code>
	     with the file <code>usml/config/matrix_expression_1_57.hpp</code>.</li>
	<li> The pedantic option does not work with Boost 1.52. There are several cases where
	     this specific version of Boost uses C++0x features, like long long value, that
	     are not supported by c++98.  Turning off the pedantic option works around this issue.
	<li> Some versions of Boost, using gcc at -O0 optimization levels, fail to properly chain multiple 
	     boost::ublas operations into a single evaluation.  When this happens, the result is 
	     equal to the first operation.  For this reason, we recommend using -O1 as the
	     minimum optimization level.
	</ul>
    <li> Use cmake-gui to generate Unix Makefiles project
	<ul>
	<li> In the <code>cmake-gui</code> tool (example below), set the source directory to the place where you
             installed the USML source code.  As suggested above source code could go in <code>"~/Projects/usml"</code>.
	<li> Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binaries directory to
             something like the <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory.  Using a binary
             directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional.
	<li> Use the "Configure" button to process the CMakeList file.
	     Select the "Unix Makefile" generator from the pop-up menu.
	<li> Change options to match your development requirements.  The default options
	     should be correct for most installations.
	<li> Hit the "Configure" button a second time, even if you have not changed any
	     options.  Hit the "Generate" button to create makefiles for your system.
	     At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
	</ul>
    <li>Run the "make" utility from <code>"~/Projects/usml-build"</code> directory to compile both
        the usml shared libraries and the usml_test regression tests.
	<ul>
	<li> You can optionally use "sudo make install" to install the compiled programs into
	     the include, lib, and src directories in /usr/local.
	</ul>
    <li> Running the "usml_test" regression test should run without errors if the
         compilation and install were successful.  Prints "*** No errors detected" if fully successful.
    <li> If this test is successful, install the USML libraries
        <ul>
        <li> Run "sudo make install" to deploy into the directory defined by the 
             <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>, which defaults to
             <code>/usr/local</code>.
        <li> USML header files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/include/usml</code>
        <li> USML libraries are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib</code>
        <li> CMake configuration files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib/cmake/USML</code>
        <li> Run "sudo make uninstall" will remove these files.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Linux using Eclipse CDT4</h2>

    This is almost identical to the setup for Unix Makefiles with some small exceptions.

    <ul>
    <li> Setting up for an "out of source" build is not optional.
    <li> Select Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles when configuring CMake.
    <li> Turn on "Advanced" options to see all of the CMake variables for Eclipse. 
	<ul> 
	<li> Check the <code>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT</code> option.
	</ul>
    <li> To import this project into Eclipse:
	<ul>
	<li> Select </code>Import...</code> from the </code>File</code> menu.
	<li> Select </code>Existing Projects into Workspace</code> under </code>General</code> folder.
	<li> Select the parent of the </code>usml</code>, such as </code>~/Projects</code>
	<li> Check the "usml-Release" </code>usml-Release</code> and </code>usml-Source</code> 
             projects and select </code>Finish</code>.
	</ul>
    <li>Select </code>Build All</code> from the </code>Build</code> menu to compile.
    </ul>

    <h2>Windows using Microsoft Visual C++</h2>

    We've tested this process using Windows 7 with:
    <ul>
	<li> 32-bit Visual Studio 2010 Express, which we downloaded for free from 
             <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_4">
             http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_4</a>
	<li> 32-bit and 64-bit Visual Studio 2013 Professional (msvc 12.0)

    </ul>
    The steps that follow are the process we used to setup USML for a 32-bit Visual Studio 2010 development environment.

	</ul>
    <li> Download the binary distribution for CMake 3.1.0
	<ul>

	     from <a href="http://www.cmake.org/download">http://www.cmake.org/download</a>.
		<ul>
		<li>Note the ’10.0’ refers to Visual Studio 10, select appropriately. 
		</ul>
	<li> Running this installer deposits the software
	     in the <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake</code> directory by default.
	<li> Rename the file <code>C:\local\boost_1_57_0\numeric\ublas\matrix_expression.hpp</code> 
	     to <code>C:\local\boost_1_57_0\numeric\ublas\matrix_expression.hpp.org</code>

        <li> Building the "uninstall" target will remove these files.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using USML with CMake</h2>
    USML does not require your project to use CMake.  However, CMake 
    configuration files are provided to automate the integration of USML,
    Boost, and NetCDF into your CMake build process, if you so choose.  The example 
    below shows a <code>CmakeList.txt</code> script that creates an USML 
    enabled executable called <code>example</code> from a notional file called <code>example.cc</code>.  
    <pre>
    cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )
    project( usml_example CXX )

    find_package( USML 1.0 REQUIRED )
    include_directories( ${USML_INCLUDES} )
    add_executable( example example.cc )
    target_link_libraries( example ${USML_LIBRARIES} )
    </pre>
    In this example, the <code>find_package</code> command uses files called
    <code>USMLConfig.cmake</code> and <code>USMLUse.cmake</code> to
    configure the include and library files for USML, Boost, and NetCDF.
    A file called <code>USMLConfigVersion.cmake</code> is used to check
    the desired USML version against the installed version.
