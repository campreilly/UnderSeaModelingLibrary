  </head>

    <h1>Building and Testing the Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.
    </p>

    <h2>Before you get started</h2>
    <p>USML depends on the NetCDF package, for access to test data, 
       and the Boost package, for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit test utilities.
       Correctly configuring these packages is the #1 problem reported by USML users.

    <p> The USML build process assumes that the software will be installed into a directory called <b>usml</b>
    and it won't build properly if that is not the case.  These instructions refer to <code>usml</code>
    as the <i>home directory</i>.  The directory that contains <code>usml</code> is refered to as 
    the <i>parent directory</i>.  The header files, *.cc source, and tests for each module are found
    in the subdirectories of <code>usml</code>. The <i>#include</i> statements in the code explicitly 
    rely on this directory structure.  For example, if sreilly decides to install USML under 
    <code>~/Projects</code> on a Linux machine, the <i>home directory</i> would be 
    <code>/home/sreilly/Projects/usml</code> and the <i>parent directory</i> would be 
    <code>/home/sreilly/Projects</code>. Confusion over this scheme is the #2 problem reported by USML users.

    <p> Before you attempt to build and test USML, please read these instructions carefully.  Good luck.

    <h2>Linux using GNU C++ and Unix Makefiles</h2>

    We've tested this process with:
    <ul>
	<li> 64-bit Oracle Linux Server 9.3 with gcc 11.4.1 using C++ 2017 standard
	<li> CMake 3.20.2
    <li> Boost 1.82.0
	<li> NetCDF C 4.3.3.1 and C++ 4.2
	<li> Git GUI 1.8.3.1
    </ul>
    The steps that follow are the process we used to setup USML for a 64-bit CentOS 7 development environment.
    We expect your environment to be a little different, but this should get you started.
    Since CentOS is derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, 
    (see <a href="http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq">http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq</a>)
    we expect this process to work identically in RHEL7.
    <ul>
    <li> Download the source code distribution for USML
	<ul>
	<li> Extract USML from the distribution media.  On Linux, these consist of
	<pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.#.#.tar.gz
	</pre>
	     where #.#.# is the version number to be installed.  
	     In this example, we'll extract them to <code>~/Projects</code>, and this
	     creates a home directory called <code>~/Projects/usml</code>
	<li> The USML build process <b>absolutely</b> requires the home directory 
	     to be named <code>usml</code>.  If you are extracting the code from another
	     source, such as GitHub, make sure to rename the home directory <code>usml</code>.
	</ul>
	<p>
     <li> Install CMake GUI, NetCDF Development, and Git GUI RPMs from the Oracle Linux servers
	<pre>
    dnf install git-gui gitk aspell-en # to install Git GUI tools
    dnf install libcanberra-gtk2 # to fix bug in git
    dnf install cmake cmake-gui # platform independent build tools
    dnf install clang-tools-extra # for the clang tidying tools
    dnf install oracle-epel-release-el8 # to enable extra libraries like netCDF
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder # to enable extra libraries like netCDF
    dnf install netcdf-cxx-devel netcdf-devel nco # to access environmental data files
    dnf install texlive doxygen graphviz # LaTex equations and UML images in doxygen
	</pre>
	<p>
    <li> Install Boost library from source code.
	<ul>
	<li> We tested this with the distribution called <code>boost_1_82_0.tar.gz</code> from 
	     <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a> and the
	     install instructions from <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html">
	    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html</a>.
  	     To install this software in <code>/usr/local</code>, these instructions boil down to:
    <li>Download boost_1_82_0.tar.gz from http://www.boost.org to /usr/local/distrib
    <li>Open a normal terminal window
	<pre>
    cd /usr/local
    tar -xvf distrib/boost_1_82_0.tar.gz
    cd boost_1_82_0
    ./bootstrap.sh (to configure gcc options)
    ./b2 (to compile Boost libraries for static and dynamic)
    sudo ./b2 install (to install boost libraries)
	</pre>
    <li>You should see boost libraries in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib directories.
    <p>
    </ul>
    <li> Use cmake-gui to generate Unix Makefiles project
	<ul>
	<li> In the <code>cmake-gui</code> tool (example below), set the source directory to the home directory where you
         installed the USML source code.  As suggested above, source code could go in <code>~/Projects/usml</code>.
	<li> Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binaries directory to
         something like the <code>~/Projects/usml/build</code> directory.  Using a binary
         directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional.
	<li> Use the <code>Configure</code> button to process the CMakeList file.
	     Select the <code>Unix Makefile</code> generator from the pop-up menu.
	<li> Change options to match your development requirements.  The default options
	     should be correct for most installations.
	<li> Hit the <code>Configure</code> button a second time, even if you have not changed any
	     options.  Hit the <code>Generate</code> button to create makefiles for your system.
	 <li> At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
	</ul>
    <p><img src="config/cmake-example.png" alt="cmake-gui example">
	<p>
    <li>Run the <code>make</code> utility from <code>~/Projects/usml/build</code> directory to compile both
        the shared libraries and the unit testing executables.
	<p>
    <li> The <code>usml_test</code> regression test in this directory should run without errors.  
         <ul>
         <li>Prints <code>*** No errors detected</code> if fully successful.
         </ul>
	<p>
    <li> If this test is successful, install the USML libraries
        <ul>
        <li> Run <code>sudo make install</code> to deploy into the directory defined by the 
             <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>, which defaults to
             <code>/usr/local</code>.
        <li> USML header files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/include/usml</code>
        <li> USML libraries are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib</code>
        <li> CMake configuration files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib/cmake/USML</code>
        <li> Run <code>sudo make uninstall</code> will remove these files.
        </ul>
	<p>
    <li> The install process can be re-run with different selections for Release/Debug
         and Static/Dynamic libraries to populate libraries with these variants.
	<ul> 
        <li> But, note that if both Static and Dynamic libraries are present in the
             same directory, the USMLConfig.cmake process will only find the dynamic ones.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using USML with CMake</h2>
    USML does not require your project to use CMake.  However, CMake 
    configuration files are provided to automate the integration of USML,
    Boost, and NetCDF into your CMake build process, if you so choose.  The example 
    below shows a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> script that creates an USML 
    enabled executable called <code>example</code> from a notional file called <code>example.cc</code>.  
    <pre>
    cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )
    project( usml_example CXX )

    find_package( USML 1.0 REQUIRED )
    include_directories( ${USML_INCLUDES} )
    add_executable( example example.cc )
    target_link_libraries( example ${USML_LIBRARIES} )
    </pre>
    In this example, the <code>find_package</code> command uses files called
    <code>USMLConfig.cmake</code> and <code>USMLUse.cmake</code> to
    configure the include and library files for USML, Boost, and NetCDF.
    A file called <code>USMLConfigVersion.cmake</code> is used to check
    the desired USML version against the installed version.
