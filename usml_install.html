    <title>Building and Testing USML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Building and Testing the Under Sea Modeling Library (USML)</h1>
    <p>
      The Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) is a collection of C++ software
      development modules for sonar modeling and simulation.
      The Wavefront Queue 3D (WaveQ3D) model is the component of USML
      that computes acoustic transmission loss in the ocean using
      Hybrid Gaussian Beams in Spherical/Time Coordinates.
      At this time, most of the other modules provide support to WaveQ3D.
    </p>

    <h2>Before you get started</h2>
    <p>USML depends on the NetCDF package, for access to test data, 
       and the Boost package, for fast computations (uBLAS) and unit test utilities.
       Correctly configuring these packages is the #1 problem reported by USML users.

    <p> The USML build process assumes that the software will be installed into a directory called <b>usml</b>
    and it won't build properly if that is not the case.  These instructions refer to <code>usml</code>
    as the <i>home directory</i>.  The directory that contains <code>usml</code> is refered to as 
    the <i>parent directory</i>.  The header files, *.cc source, and tests for each module are found
    in the subdirectories of <code>usml</code>. The <i>#include</i> statements in the code explicitly 
    rely on this directory structure.  For example, if sreilly decides to install USML under 
    <code>~/Projects</code> on a Linux machine, the <i>home directory</i> would be 
    <code>/home/sreilly/Projects/usml</code> and the <i>parent directory</i> would be 
    <code>/home/sreilly/Projects</code>. Confusion over this scheme is the #2 problem reported by USML users.

    <p> Before you attempt to build and test USML, please read these instructions carefully.  Good luck.

    <h2>Linux using GNU C++ and Unix Makefiles</h2>

    We've tested this process with:
    <ul>
	<li> 64-bit CentOS 7 with gcc 4.8.5
	<li> CMake 3.6.3
    <li> Boost 1.66.0
	<li> NetCDF C 4.3.3.1 and C++ 4.2
	<li> Git GUI 1.8.3.1
    </ul>
    The steps that follow are the process we used to setup USML for a 64-bit CentOS 7 development environment.
    We expect your environment to be a little different, but this should get you started.
    Since CentOS is derived from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, 
    (see <a href="http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq">http://community.redhat.com/centos-faq</a>)
    we expect this process to work identically in RHEL7.
    <ul>
    <li> Download the source code distribution for USML
	<ul>
	<li> Extract USML from the distribution media.  On Linux, these consist of
	<pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.#.#.tar.gz
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.#.#.tar.gz
	</pre>
	     where #.#.# is the version number to be installed.  
	     In this example, we'll extract them to <code>~/Projects</code>, and this
	     creates a home directory called <code>~/Projects/usml</code>
	<li> The USML build process <b>absolutely</b> requires the home directory 
	     to be named <code>usml</code>.  If you are extracting the code from another
	     source, such as GitHub, make sure to rename the home directory <code>usml</code>.
	</ul>
	<p>
     <li> Install CMake GUI, NetCDF Development, and Git GUI RPMs from the CentOS yum servers
	<pre>
	sudo yum install epel-release (to add EPEL repository to yum config)
	sudo yum install cmake3-gui (to install CMake 3.6.3)
	sudo yum install netcdf-cxx-devel netcdf-devel nco (to install NetCDF C 4.3.3.1 and C++ 4.2)
	sudo yum install git-gui gitk (to install Git GUI 1.8.3.1 tools)
	</pre>
	<ul>
     <li>If you do not have access to the CentOS yum servers, you can find the needed RPMs from the <a href="https://centos.pkgs.org">https://centos.pkgs.org</a> site.
	</ul>
	<p>
    <li> Install Boost library from source code.
	<ul>
	<li> We tested this with the distribution called <code>boost_1_66_0.tar.gz</code> from 
	     <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a> and the
	     install instructions from <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html">
	    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html</a>.
  	     To install this software in <code>/usr/local</code>, these instructions boil down to:
	<ul>
    <li>Download boost_1_66_0.tar.gz from http://www.boost.org to /usr/local/distrib
    <li>Open a normal terminal window
	<pre>
    cd /usr/local
    tar -xvf distrib/boost_1_66_0.tar.gz
    cd boost_1_66_0
    ./bootstrap.sh (to configure gcc options)
    ./b2 (to compile Boost libraries for static and dynamic)
    sudo ./b2 install (to install boost libraries)
	</pre>
    <li>You should see boost libraries in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib directories.
	</ul>
    <li> There is a bug in the Boost uBLAS library that vector and matrix scaling using 
	    <code>operator/()</code> in Boost versions prior to 1.58.
	<li> Some versions of Boost, using gcc at -O0 optimization levels, fail to properly chain multiple 
	     boost::ublas operations into a single evaluation.  When this happens, the result is 
	     equal to the first operation.  For this reason, we recommend using -O1 as the
	     minimum optimization level.
	</ul>
	<p>
    <li> Use cmake-gui to generate Unix Makefiles project
	<ul>
	<li> In the <code>cmake-gui</code> tool (example below), set the source directory to the home directory where you
             installed the USML source code.  As suggested above source code could go in <code>~/Projects/usml</code>.
	<li> Setup for an "out of source" build by setting the binaries directory to
             something like the <code>~/Projects/usml-build</code> directory.  Using a binary
             directory that is not outside of the source tree is strictly optional.
	<li> Use the <code>Configure</code> button to process the CMakeList file.
	     Select the <code>Unix Makefile</code> generator from the pop-up menu.
	<li> Change options to match your development requirements.  The default options
	     should be correct for most installations.
	<li> Hit the <code>Configure</code> button a second time, even if you have not changed any
	     options.  Hit the <code>Generate</code> button to create makefiles for your system.
	 <li> At this point, you can close the cmake-gui tool.
	</ul>
	<p>
    <li>Run the <code>make</code> utility from <code>~/Projects/usml-build</code> directory to compile both
	<p>
    <li> The <code>usml_test</code> regression test in this directory should run without errors.  
         <ul>
         <li>Prints <code>*** No errors detected</code> if fully successful.
         </ul>
	<p>
    <li> If this test is successful, install the USML libraries
        <ul>
        <li> Run <code>sudo make install</code> to deploy into the directory defined by the 
             <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>, which defaults to
             <code>/usr/local</code>.
        <li> USML header files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/include/usml</code>
        <li> USML libraries are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib</code>
        <li> CMake configuration files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib/cmake/USML</code>
        <li> Run <code>sudo make uninstall</code> will remove these files.
        </ul>
	<p>
    <li> The install process can be re-run with different selections for Release/Debug
         and Static/Dynamic libraries to populate libraries with these variants.
	<ul> 
        <li> But, note that if both Static and Dynamic libraries are present in the
             same directory, the USMLConfig.cmake process will only find the dynamic ones.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Linux using Eclipse CDT4</h2>

    This is almost identical to the setup for Unix Makefiles with some small exceptions.

    <ul>
    <li> Setting up for an "out of source" build is not optional.
    <li> Select Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles when configuring CMake.
    <li> Turn on <code>Advanced</code> options to see all of the CMake variables for Eclipse. 
	<ul> 
	<li> Check the <code>CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT</code> option.
	</ul>
    <li> To import this project into Eclipse:
	<ul>
	<li> Select </code>Import...</code> from the </code>File</code> menu.
	<li> Select </code>Existing Projects into Workspace</code> under </code>General</code> folder.
	<li> Select the parent of the </code>usml</code>, such as <code>~/Projects</code>
	<li> Check the </code>usml-Release</code> and </code>usml-Source</code> 
             projects and select </code>Finish</code>.
	</ul>
    <li>Select </code>Build All</code> from the </code>Build</code> menu to compile.
    </ul>

    <h2>Windows using Microsoft Visual C++</h2>

    We've tested this process using Windows 7 with:
    <ul>
	<li> 64-bit Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
	<lI> CMake 3.11.0-rc1
    <li> Boost 1.66.0
	<li> NetCDF C 4.6.0
	<li> Git GUI 2.16.1.4
    </ul>
    The steps that follow are the process we used to setup USML for a 64-bit Visual Studio 2017 development environment.
    We expect your environment to be a little different, but this should get you started.
    <ul>
    <li> Download the source code distribution for USML
	<ul>
	<li> Extract USML from the distribution media.  On Windows, these consist of
	<pre>
        tar -xzf usml-src-#.#.#.zip
        tar -xzf usml-doc-#.#.#.zip
        tar -xzf usml-data-#.#.#.zip
	</pre>
	     where #.#.# is the version number to be installed.  
	     In this example, we extracted them to <code>C:\Projects</code>, and this
	     created a directory called <code>C:\Projects\usml</code>
	 <li> The USML build process <b>absolutely</b> requires the home directory          
              to be named <code>usml</code>.  If you are extracting the code from another
              source, such as GitHub, make sure to rename the home directory to <code>usml</code>.
	</ul>
    <li> Download the binary distribution for CMake 3.11.0-rc1
	<ul>
    <li> CMake has some trouble resolving the Boost dependencie under Windows, and only the latest CMake builds
            will work with the last Boost builds.
            <ul>
            <li> Boost 1.63 requires CMake 3.7 or newer
            <li> Boost 1.64 requires CMake 3.8 or newer
            <li> Boost 1.65 and 1.65.1 require CMake 3.9.3 or newer
            <li> Boost 1.66 is supported by CMake 3.11 or newer
            </ul>
	<li> We used the Windows win64-x64 installer called <code>cmake-3.11.0-rc1-win64-x64.msi</code>, 
	     from <a href="http://www.cmake.org/download">http://www.cmake.org/download</a>.
	<li> Running this installer deposits the software
	     in the <code>C:\Program Files\CMake</code> directory by default.
	</ul>
    <li> Install Boost library from source code.
	<ul>
	<li> We tested this with the distribution called <code>boost_1_66_0.tar.gz</code> from 
	     <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a> and the
	     install instructions from <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html">
	    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html</a>.
  	     To install this software in <code>/usr/local</code>, these instructions boil down to:
    <li>Download boost_1_66_0.zip from http://www.boost.org and unzip it into a local building area such as C:\Projects directory.
    <li>Open a Windows command window
	<pre>
    cd \Projects\boost_1_66_0
    bootstrap (to configure Visual Studio options)
    b2 (to compile Boost static libraries for Release and Debug)
    b2 install (to install boost libraries into C:\Boost)
	</pre>
    <li>You should see boost libraries in C:\Boost\include and C:\Boost\lib directories.
	</ul>
    <li> Download the pre-built Windows binaries for NetCDF-C 4.6.0,
	<ul>
	<li> We used the Win32 installer called <code>netCDF4.6.0-NC4-DAP-64.exe</code> from 
	     <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html">
	     http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html</a>
	<li> Running this installer deposits the software in the 
	     <code>C:\Program Files\netCDF 4.6.0</code> directory by default.
	</ul>
    <li> Add NetCDF and USML environment variables
	<ul>
	<li> Right click on Computer, select Properties <code>-></code> Advanced system settings <code>-></code> Environment Variables.
	<li> Create new user variable <code>NETCDF_DIR=C:\Program Files\netCDF 4.6.0 </code> or equivalent.
	<li> Create new user variable <code>USML_DIR</code> for the USML installation directory.
	     We used <code>C:\local\usml</code> to avoid permission problems installing libraries
          into <code>Program Files</code>,
	<li> Finally, add <code>%BOOST_LIBRARY_DIR%;%NETCDF_DIR%\bin;%USML_DIR%\lib</code> to the <code>Path</code> variable.
	</ul>
    <li> Use cmake-gui to generate Visual Studio project
	<ul>
	<li> We set <code>Where is the source code:</code> to <code>C:\Projects\usml</code>.
	<li> We set <code>Where to build the binaries:</code> to <code>C:\Projects\usml-build</code>
	     to create an out-of-source build.
	<li> Hit <code>Configure</code> button, select your version of Visual Studio.
	<li> If status shows <code>Configuring done</code>, hit <code>Configure</code> again, then <code>Generate</code>.
	</ul>
    <li> Use Visual Studio to build project
	<ul>
	<li> Open the file <code>usml.sln</code>, in the build directory, using Visual Studio
	<li> Select <code>Rebuild Solution</code> from <code>Build</code> menu.
	</ul>
    <li> Test the ability to run USML applications
	<ul>
	<li> Right click on the <code>usml_test</code> target and select
             <code>Set as StartUp Project</code>.
        <li> Select <code>Start Without Debugging</code> under the <code>Debug</code> menu.
	<li> Test fully successful if <code>*** No errors detected</code> printed to screen.
	</ul>
    <li> If this test is successful, install the USML libraries
        <ul>
        <li> Select <code>Batch Build...</code> under the <code>Build</code> menu.
        <li> Check the <code>Build</code> checkbox next to the <code>Debug</code> 
             and <code>Release</code> versions of the <code>INSTALL</code> targets.
	<li> Click on the <code>Build</code> button to compile and deploy these 
             releases into the directory defined by the <code>USML_DIR</code> prefix.
	    <ul>
            <li> USML header files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/include/usml</code>
            <li> USML libraries are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/lib</code>
            <li> CMake configuration files are written to <code>&ltprefix&gt/CMake</code>
	    </ul>
        <li> Building the <code>uninstall</code> target will remove these files.
        <li> Note that if both Static and Dynamic libraries are created in the
             same directory, the *.lib files will overwrite each other.

        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using USML with CMake</h2>
    USML does not require your project to use CMake.  However, CMake 
    configuration files are provided to automate the integration of USML,
    Boost, and NetCDF into your CMake build process, if you so choose.  The example 
    below shows a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> script that creates an USML 
    enabled executable called <code>example</code> from a notional file called <code>example.cc</code>.  
    <pre>
    cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 2.6 )
    project( usml_example CXX )

    find_package( USML 1.0 REQUIRED )
    include_directories( ${USML_INCLUDES} )
    add_executable( example example.cc )
    target_link_libraries( example ${USML_LIBRARIES} )
    </pre>
    In this example, the <code>find_package</code> command uses files called
    <code>USMLConfig.cmake</code> and <code>USMLUse.cmake</code> to
    configure the include and library files for USML, Boost, and NetCDF.
    A file called <code>USMLConfigVersion.cmake</code> is used to check
    the desired USML version against the installed version.
