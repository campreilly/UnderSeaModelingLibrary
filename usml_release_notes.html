    <h1>Under Sea Modeling Library (USML) Release Notes</h1>

    <h2>Release 0.03</h2>
    <ul>
	    <li>Introduced the ability to accumulate energy across ray families by adding virutal
	    rays to the end of each ray family and allows the needed support at the edge of ray
	    families. This first exhibited during the lloyds_depth_proploss test. As the TL was 
	    calculated closer and closer to the surface, the TL got further and further from the 
	    theoretical values and introducing these virtual rays rectified this issue.
	    <li>Made a significant change to the way that wavefronts are collected into families.
		The on_edge logic no longer uses the number of surface and bottom bounces to determine
		the location of a fold in the wavefront. This logic fails in ducts because the bounces
		do not always result in a fold. As a consequence of this change, the on_fold logic was
		removed and significantly simplified the way that caustics are detected.
		<li>The reflect_loss_rayleigh mogdel had a bug where speed_shear was not being scaled
		correctly. Now the results of the plot_rayleigh_sediments match Fig 1.24 in Jensen,
		Kuperman, et al. Simplified the conversion from dB/wavelength to loss tanget by
		defining ATT_CONVERT constant.
		<li>Created the ascii_arc_bathy model to extract Coastal Relief Model (CRM) bathymetry
		data. This data is produced by the NGDC web site as ASCII files with an ARC header.
		<li>Created reflect_loss_netcdf model to read provinced bottom loss data from netCDF
		file. Assumes that each of the provinces and be modelled using the reflect_loss_rayleigh 
		model, and that the provinces define the province number as a function of latitude
		and logitude. Each province number corresponds to a specific comination of geophysical
		properties (aka reflect_loss_rayleigh arguments).
		<li>The "too shallow" calculation in the reflection_model was not normalizing the theta
		and phi components of the normal correctly. And this allowed them to be much greater 
		than 1, which lead to crazy jumps.
		<li>The boundary_grid model has a sqrt() in the calculation of the rho component of 
		the normal. If the gradients were very large, the sum of the squares of the theta and
		phi componenets were slightly greater than 1. This leads to a rho value of NaN, and 
		then everything turns bad.
		<li>Enabled floating point exception traps when USML_DEBUG is set. Uses the GCC 
		constructor attributes (a C language extension) to invoke the feenableexcept() 
		function whent he shared library is loaded. Only supported by GCC compilers and shared
		libraries at this time.
		<li>Discovered math overflow using "float" for bathymetry. Replaced all "float" with
		"double".
		<li>Added the ability to limit interpolation locations to values inside of the lat/long
		boundaries of the bathymetry and profile grids.
		<li>Corrected an error in pchip algorithm in data_grid (y3=y2 and not y2=y2).
		<li>Added great circle range/bearing calculations to wposition1. Frequently used 
		during testing.
		<li>Developed a cmp_speed study to compare WaveQ3D speeds with CASS/GRAB scenario 
		based on STD14. Built CASS runstreams to compute transmission loss for 1, 10, 20, 30, 
		..., 100 targets. Implemented as a ring of receivers at 100 km from source.
		<li>Changed profile_mackenzie to set edge_limit in the depth direction to true. 
		Eliminated cases where extrapolation outside of the water column was leading to NaN 
		in ray trace of ray_speed. This, in turn, was causing ray_speed to run very slow.
		<li>Prevent the first longitude point in the extraction from netCDF files from using
		lng_first index values that were smaller than zero. Effects netcdf_profile and 
		netcdf_bathymetry models.
		<li>Updated CMake process to support: install targets, included the libraries for zlib, 
		hdf5, and curl that were required for NetCDF 4.
		<li>Added reflect_loss_rayleigh parameters for MUD bottoms.
		<li>In netccdf_profile, changed NcError to silent_nonfatal instead of verbose to prevent 
		the extra line print out.
		<li>Updated documentation to include BSD 2-Clauses License.
		<li>Migrate test platform to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS from 10.04.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Release 0.02</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Convert to CMake build system to support multiple operating systems.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Port the library to Windows using Visual C++ 2010 Express.</li>
        <li>Eliminate the need for USML_ROOT environment variable.</li>
        <li>Define symbols for test data files in CMakeLists file.</li>
        <li>Quitely fail some tests w/o errors if current platform does not 
            include the ncks utility.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Fix vector/matrix operations with scalars.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Requires upgrade of Boost library to version 1.48.0 or better.</li>
        <li>Use enable_if<> template like 1.48.0 version of ublas.</li>
        <li>Before this fix, scalar addition with vector/matrix just resulted
            in the original vector/matrix on Windows.<li>
        <li>This fix fixed the errors in dot_test and distance_test.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Use operator*() and operator/() as aliases for element_prod() and element_div().</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Requires a bug fix in ublas itself.</li>
        <li>file: boost/numeric/ublas/vector_expression.hpp lines 1409 through 1417
            Should be using the enable_if<> macros just like the operator*()
            in lines 1397 through 1407 (just above it).  Doing so allows further
            overloading of operator/() for other types.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in wave_front::find_edges().  First loop on line 201 said max_az
        when it should have said max_de.</li>
    <li>Fixed memory leaks in the way that tests were using NetCDF.  Calls to 
        get_att() and values() require the user to free the memory when they are down with it.</li>
    <li>Change the name of wave_q3d to waveq3d.</li>
    <li>Move eigenray_llyods to studies directory because it runs slow.</li>
    </ul>
