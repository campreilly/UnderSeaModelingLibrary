 * @internal
 * Reflection model components of wave_queue object type.
 * These routines have been broken out into their own class just to
 * simplify maintenance of the reflection model components separately
 * from the core of the propagation engine.
 *
 * The wave_queue::detect_reflections_surface() and
 * wave_queue::detect_reflections_bottom() routines detect
 * when a collision has occurred. Then, this class is used to:
 *
 * - compute a refined location and grazing angle of the collision,
 * - reflect the current wavefront into a new direction, and
 * - re-initialize the wavefront queue for the reflected ray such that
 *   it appears to be coming from an image source on the other side
 *   of the interface.
 *
 * The accuracy limits in this part of the model cause slight fluctuations in
 * the direction of the reflected rays.  If a very finely gridded fan is
 * used, these fluctuation will manifest themselves as gaps between each
 * groups of rays that encountered the interface at a different time steps.
 * Since the divergence of the wavefront is estimated using the spreading
 * between rays, this causes a discontinuity in the propagation loss.
 * When the ray spacing is coarser, these gaps are washed out in the
 * other approximations between rays.  This effect can also be minimized
 * by decreasing the time step.
 *
 * @todo Calculate eigenray amplitude and phase for reverberation callback.
 * Just passing bogus values currently.
