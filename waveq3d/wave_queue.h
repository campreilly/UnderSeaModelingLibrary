     *
     * If the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is very small, the inverse is
     * unstable, and this implementation falls back to a 2x2 calculation
     * in the time and AZ directions.  If the determinant of the 2x2 matrix
     * is also very small,  This implementation falls back to a solution that
     * just uses the diagonal of the Hessian.
     * <pre>
     *              x(n) = - g(n) / H(n,n)
     * </pre>
     * This fallback solution is limited to 1/2 of the beamwidth.  If this
     * clipping is not performed, the eigenray_extra_test/eigenray_lloyds
     * will generate significant errors in D/E.  But including this clipping
     * leads to large D/E errors when the target is outside of the ray fan,
     * like it is in the Bottom Bounce path for eigenray_test/eigenray_basic.

     * If this Taylor series around the CPA is unstable, this implementation
     * reverts to a simpler calculation that limits the inverse to the
     * time and AZ directions.  The neighborhood is treated as unstable if:
     *
     *  - The number of surface, bottom, and caustics is not the same for
     *    wavefront points around the CPA.
     *  - One of the wavefront points around the CPA is on the edge
     *    of the wavefront.
     *  - The determinant of the full Hesssian is very small, which indicates
     *    that the inverse unstable.
     *  - The DE offset computed by the full inverse is more than 50% of the
     *    beam width.
     *
     * If the neighborhood is unstable, the distance in the DE direction
     * is computed by subtracting the time and AZ distance from the total
     * distances at CPA.
